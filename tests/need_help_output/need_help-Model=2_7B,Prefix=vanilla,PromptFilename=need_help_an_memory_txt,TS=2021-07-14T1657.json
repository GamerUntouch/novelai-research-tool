He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",

I tell him about my parents, my friends, my interests, etc.  I don't want to bore him, so I try to keep it lighthearted, but I have to admit that I do get a little nervous talking to him.\nDr. Szozo asks, \"What type of work do you do?\"\nI tell him, \"I'm a freelance writer/artist. I also teach college English, and I tutor high school kids.\"\nHe nods, \"That sounds like a busy job. Why don't we talk about this more? Let's start with what led you to contact me today.\"\nI tell him about my issues, and he listens intently, asking questions about my childhood, my family, my upbringing, my problems, etc. He then asks, \"Do you have a history of sexual abuse?\"\nI nod, \"Yes, I was sexually abused when I was a child. I was molested by my father, and I was raped by my stepfather.\"\nHe nods, \"How old were you when they did that to you?\"\nI say, \"I was 7 years old when I was molested. I was 12 when I was raped. I was 13 when I was assaulted.\"\nHe nods, \"Were you ever treated for those injuries?\"\nI nod, \"Yes, I was taken to the hospital several times after that happened. My stepfather had his hands all over me, and I was tied up with ropes and chains during my visits to the hospital. He would threaten to kill me if I told anyone about the abuse.\"\nHe nods, \"Did you ever tell anyone about the abuse?\"",

  "prompt": "I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",
  "result": "My name is Jonathan. My problem is that I've been having sex with women while I'm married to my wife. I don't know what happened, but I think we had better have a talk.\"\nHe looks at me curiously, \"What do you mean by 'while you're married?'\"\nI can't believe this is happening, but I tell him, \"Well, I've been having sex with them while I'm fucking my wife. I want to stop, but I don't know what to do.\"\nHe nods, \"I understand completely. Tell me more about exactly what you did, and describe any circumstances that may have led to this behavior.\"\nI feel myself flush red, \"Well, I guess I should start off by telling you all about the last time I had sex with one of these women. I met her at the gym, and she was a very attractive woman, blonde, and athletic. I'd never seen such a beautiful woman before, and I couldn't wait to get home to fuck her. She said she lived near the fitness center, so I thought I'd give it a shot. We went out for drinks after work, and I brought her back to my place. I fucked her right there in my living room, then I took her to my bedroom and fucked her again. The second time, I felt something strange, and I didn't know what it was. I kept fucking her, and I felt even stronger sensations, and I knew I wasn't going to last long. I tried to pull out, but I couldn't, and I came too soon. I got really turned on, and I started to cum, and I heard a noise. I looked up, and there was a girl standing there, watching me. She seemed to be upset, and she asked if I was OK. I told her I was fine, and I just needed to go home. She walked out, and I realized the noises I'd been",
