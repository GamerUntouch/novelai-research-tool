His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

It started when we moved to this new house, and now things have gotten worse. My husband doesn't seem to understand what's happening to me, and I don't know where else to turn. I feel so alone, so confused.\"\nSzozas smiles at me, \"So tell me more about yourself: What brought you to seek help? Where did you go before coming to us?\"\nI begin to speak, telling him all about myself, the way I was raised, and the fact that I had always felt different than everyone else, and that I'd never fit in anywhere, not even when I was growing up. The loneliness and isolation were overwhelming, and there seemed to be no hope for change or relief. But slowly, as I spoke, I began to realize that maybe there was something wrong with me, and I didn't want anyone else to suffer the same fate I did.\nThen I went on to describe the changes I noticed in myself, and the feelings I experienced. I explained that I had become afraid to leave the house, and that I wasn't able to sleep at night anymore, and that I would wake up crying almost constantly, sometimes for hours at a time.

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

You can tell me anything, any time, anytime, anywhere. It will stay between us, unless there are problems.\"\nI nod, but I still can't meet his gaze.\nDr. Szozas continues, \"Now, why are you here today?\"\nMy head snaps up, and I stare right back at him. \"I need help.\"\nHe chuckles, and leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees, \"Well, let's start with why you think that might be necessary.\"\nThis is not good! \"Because I've been having nightmares, waking up sweating, feeling sick to my stomach, unable to sleep, but I can't stop thinking about them!\"\nHe sits upright, leaning back against the chair, and puts his hands together, clasping his thumbs, while staring at the ceiling, \"Tell me more about the dreams.\"\nSo I do, about the strange dream where I was being chased by a wolf pack, and they were hunting me. About the dream where I was floating through the sky, above the clouds, with the moon shining brightly, but I couldn't fly because I was too scared.

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

My mother always said that doctors should never ask personal questions unless they were necessary, so I try to keep things simple. \"My problem is this: I have been experiencing a lot of stress lately, and I've started having trouble sleeping, especially during the night. And I find myself crying quite often, without any real reason.\"\nHe nods sympathetically, then looks back at me, waiting.\n\"It all started just after our trip to the Grand Canyon last month,\" I continue. \"We went there together with two other couples, including my parents and sister. It was such a wonderful time we had, but now...\" I stop talking, unable to finish the thought.\nDr. Szozas sits quietly for several moments before asking, \"Ayla, do you think you would feel better if you talked about what happened?\"\n\"Yes,\" I answer honestly. \"But not right away; I need to collect my thoughts first. Maybe later today.\"\n\"OK, let's start with the basics. What is your age? How long have you lived in New York City? Do you have family nearby?\"\n\"I'm 28 years old, I was born and raised in California, but I moved to NYC six months ago. I live alone, no children yet.\"\n\"How does that work out with the job you're doing?\" he asks gently.\n\"Well, I don't really know. I've worked part-time jobs before, but I haven't done anything steady since I was about 15 or 16. I was a waitress, but I didn't like that too much; I was a receptionist for a few different companies, but I quit because I couldn't stand the hours, the pressure, the people...
