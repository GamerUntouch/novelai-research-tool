My name is Rebecca."
He nods, and asks, "And why have you chosen this particular therapist?"
I pause again, wondering if there is any way to explain without sounding like I'm making excuses... I decide to just tell the truth. "Well, after reading all the testimonials online, they say that you specialize in unusual cases. And I've been feeling very off lately. My moods seem to swing wildly between depression and anger, and sometimes I feel like I can hear voices inside my head..."
Dr. Szozas smiles kindly, "That sounds pretty unusual, don't you think? Are you taking medication?"
I shake my head. "No. Not since high school."
"So, what do you suppose brought on such a change in behavior? What happened recently?"
It feels strange talking about myself to another person; I'm usually the one doing the asking. But now I'm being asked questions, and I'm answering them honestly. "I started dating a guy named Henry last month, and we were getting along really well. We went out on dates a few times, and then we had sex once. It was good. Really good, but something changed afterward; I wasn't the same. I felt different. Like I wanted more, but I couldn't figure out exactly what that meant."
Dr. Szozas listens attentively, and when I finish, I realize that I haven't actually answered his question yet. I look up at his face, trying to find the right words to describe the changes that I'd experienced, but I can't quite put it into words that are meaningful to me. I try to articulate my feelings about the situation, but I'm not sure if I should be telling the doctor about the sensations that I'd felt or the emotions that I'd felt during the course of the evening with Henry. I get up from the couch, and walk over to stand before Dr. Szozas

My name is Daphne Kastle."
He nods slowly, then asks, "And why have you sought professional help?"
Now I feel even more uncomfortable than before. I'm not sure where this is leading, but I can tell that something bad is coming. Something horrible... maybe? And I know that there is nothing I can do about it, so I just say, "It's hard to explain..."
A slight frown crosses his face, "Well let's start by getting those thoughts out of your head. You said you were trying to find answers, right? Well we'll get started finding them together, alright?" He smiles again, "We should probably begin with what brought you here today, though."
So I tell him about the weird dreams I've been having lately, and all the things that are happening to me. About how I think I may be losing control of myself, about how I don't understand it. About how I'm scared that I might hurt people or cause harm to others because of the changes in me. He listens intently, nodding occasionally, asking questions when necessary.
"Have you ever had any sort of mental health problems prior to now?" he inquires gently, and I shake my head no.
Then he continues, "You seem to be a very intelligent young woman; I suspect that the answer lies within you. The good news is that I believe that I can help you with whatever is troubling you. I'd like to ask you a few simple questions to try to ascertain exactly what is going on inside of your mind, okay?"
I nod my agreement.
The first question is easy enough: "What is the last thing that you remember clearly, before waking up from the nightmare that caused you to come to me today?"
I pause, thinking. "I was at work, at the library. I was working late, reading a book. I was startled awake by a noise, I looked

My name is Evan."
He nods once, "And why have you come?"
"Well... uh..." My mind races. What do I say? How can I explain this?
"Evan," he prompts gently, "You don't need to worry about being embarrassed. You've got nothing to hide, and we'll get to the bottom of whatever is troubling you. Why don't you start by telling me what happened to change your life forever?"
What changed my life forever? That's a good question, one that I think about often. There are moments when I wake up in bed, and remember something horrible that happened to me. It usually involves a friend or family member, but sometimes it's an animal, or a stranger. But then there are other times when I forget all about it until I feel a sense of unease. Something is wrong with me, but I just can't put my finger on it. And now I know that I'm not alone; that others have had similar experiences, and they've come to a place like this.
So I tell him about the dreams and memories, and how they seem to be getting worse lately. He listens intently while I speak, nodding occasionally, asking questions when appropriate. The more I talk, the better I feel. I realize that I am relieved to be able to share this with somebody, and that I am even beginning to relax.
Dr. Szozas sits quietly after I finish talking, his face impassive, "Do you ever dream about the past?"
That is such a strange question, but I answer, "Yes, but only when I am asleep. I try to avoid them when I am awake, because I am afraid that I will be affected if I am dreaming about the future."
"How long has this been happening to you?"
"Since I was about 12 years old. I guess that I started having the nightmares about a year ago.

My name is Angela Marie Davis, and I'm here because I have been experiencing strange phenomena."
He nods slowly, waiting patiently for more information.
"Well, I don't know where to start..." I say, trying to find the right words to describe what is happening to me. My head feels funny, and my mind is spinning around. It isn't just one phenomenon either... there are many things that happen simultaneously.
Dr. Szozas leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees, "Just tell me what you've experienced thus far?"
So I begin talking, describing the weird feelings in my body, the confusion, the fear, the anger. The paranoia.
He listens intently, nodding along as I talk.
When I finish, he asks, "Have any other people noticed this? Have they seen anything unusual?"
"Yes," I reply, "my boyfriend, Robert Williams, has seen something too."
"And how did he react when he saw whatever it was?"
"It scared the hell out of him," I admit. "But then again, I suppose it would scare anyone."
Dr. Szozas sits back up straight, and gives me a quizzical look.
"What do you think caused all this?" He asks.
"I really can't explain it very well. I wish I knew, but I don't. I'm not sure if I'm having a breakdown or if I'm going crazy. I'm not sure if I'm losing control or if I'm gaining control. I feel like I'm being pulled in different directions, but I'm not sure which way to go."
He sighs heavily, and rubs his forehead with his fingertips.
"Angela, I'm sorry, but I'm not a specialist in these matters; I only treat patients who come to me with physical ailments or psychological problems. I'm afraid that I won't be able to help you

My name is Victoria." And then I pause. My heart races, and I feel myself blush a little, "Um... I don't know why I'm here..."
He smiles again, this time more broadly, "Well, we'll get to that. First things first, let's talk about what happened yesterday, shall we?"
I nod, "Yes sir."
"So, tell me, have you been experiencing any changes in your life recently? Any new challenges or difficulties? Things that aren't normal for you?"
I shake my head, "No, nothing really stands out. Just the usual stuff that everyone goes through, right?"
Dr. Szozas nods, "That's good. You've had no problems since coming to school, correct?"
"Not until yesterday morning, when I woke up with the feeling that something wasn't quite right, but I couldn't figure out what it was."
"What did you do after waking up?"
"Nothing. I just got dressed and went downstairs, where I met with Mr. Andrews about the work assignment that I didn't finish last night. We talked about a few other things, but mostly I just listened to him drone on about the project that I was supposed to help with."
"And that was when the trouble started?"
I shrug, "Yeah, I guess. I felt a sort of tingling sensation in my legs, but I thought maybe I'd gotten a cramp or something. But when I tried to stand up, I realized that I couldn't move them at all. It was like I was stuck to the floor. I called out to Mr. Andrews, but he didn't hear me or care; he just kept talking. I panicked a bit, but I knew that I needed to stay calm, so I closed my eyes and concentrated. After about ten seconds I could finally get the strength back into my legs, and I stood up. I looked

My name is Alyssa."
He nods, "That's fine, now tell me why you're here?"
Again, I pause, unsure what to say next. My mind races, trying to find something to relate this strange experience to, "Well... uhm..."
A smile plays across his lips, and he leans forward in his chair, placing both elbows onto the arms, "Why don't we start by telling each other our names? That way we can get to know one another better."
This makes sense to me, and I nod in agreement, "OK then, my name is Alyssa..."
"Ah yes, I'm Michael, and you are Alyssa?" He smiles again, and I return the gesture, "Now let's go back a few days ago, when you were feeling quite ill, shall we?"
I think about that, and try to remember if anything odd happened before I felt sick, "Uhm.. well there was a party last night. And um, and the morning after that I had trouble sleeping."
Dr. Szozas raises an eyebrow, "And did those things have any effect on your current state?"
I shake my head, "No, not really. I'm still pretty tired, but I haven't slept much at all since the party. I'm not sure why I feel so off though. It feels like I've been hit with a ton of bricks. I just want to sleep forever, but I keep waking up. I'm not sure why I'm having such a hard time with this, but I'm scared that I'm going crazy, or that I'm losing control somehow. I'm not even sure what I'm supposed to be doing with myself right now."
Michael sits quietly, thinking, and I wait patiently. Eventually, I notice that he is rubbing his chin with his thumb and forefinger, his expression thoughtful.
"Alyssa, I'm

My name is Rebecca Cooper."
He nods, "And why did you contact me?"
I exhale slowly, "Well... I've been having trouble sleeping lately. And reading about sleep disorders online led me to believe there may be something wrong with me, because I don't get much rest."
"Do you have any symptoms? Do you feel tired all the time? Any other issues that might cause difficulty getting enough sleep?"
I nod, "Yes. It started maybe two weeks ago, and now it feels like I can barely keep my head above water..." I pause, thinking, then continue, "...and when I do try to sleep, I wake up feeling like I haven't slept at all."
Dr. Szozas smiles, "Can you give me an example?"
I think back, trying to remember what happened when I went to bed last night. My mind goes blank after a few seconds, "Um... I guess not. I just woke up this morning, and felt terrible. Like I hadn't gotten any proper sleep at all. But I'm fine now, though."
"So you had a bad night's sleep, but now you're feeling better?"
I shake my head, "No, I still feel awful. I was hoping that I would be able to go to sleep tonight, but I couldn't even close my eyes. I kept waking up, and I was really frustrated. I wanted to go to sleep, but I just couldn't seem to do it. I tried to read a book, but I couldn't concentrate at all. I thought about calling a friend to hang out with, but I didn't want to bother them. I was afraid that they'd be upset with me if I called to say I was too exhausted to come out. I was worried that I was being rude. I was just so frustrated that I couldn't find a way to relax, that I was starting to feel angry at myself,

My name is Melanie Taylor."
He nods, "And why do you think you're here?"
"Well..." I begin, and then pause again, thinking carefully before answering, "I don't know exactly...it feels like something is wrong with me, and I can't figure out what it is."
Dr. Szozas smiles kindly, "OK, let's start there. Tell me more about this feeling."
So I explain, telling him about the weird dreams, the odd behavior, the fear that keeps creeping up on me whenever I try to sleep. And as I talk, I realize that he isn't listening to me; instead, his gaze is focused on me, like he's trying to read my mind somehow. When I finish, he sits silently for several seconds, taking all of this in. I feel uncomfortable under his intense stare, so I shift uncomfortably on the sofa, fidgeting with one leg while waiting for his next words.
After a moment or two, he speaks quietly, "Melanie, I want to ask you a question: Do you believe that people have souls? That they are alive after death?"
I nod, still unsure if I'm supposed to answer the question.
Dr. Szozas continues, "Do you believe that the soul is a part of us that survives our bodies, and lives forever? Or does the soul die with the body, and is gone forever when the person dies?"
Again I nod, and I say, "That sounds right to me, I guess."
Dr. Szozas grins, "Thank you, Melanie. I wanted to get that out of the way, because I think that is a very important issue to consider. I'll tell you what, I'd like to schedule an appointment with a colleague of mine, a Dr. Tasha Bannister; she is an expert at treating issues related to the afterlife and the spiritual realm. She

My name is Rebecca Thomas."
He nods encouragingly, "And why did you decide to contact me?"
Again, I pause, trying to figure out how much information I can safely give this doctor without getting myself into trouble. Finally, I answer, "Well... I've been having problems lately. It started after I graduated college last year. I had just finished school, and I was working part time at a fast food place, when one day I got really sick. My stomach hurt all the way through lunch, and by dinner I felt terrible. I went home early, and I spent most of the night puking up my guts. When morning came, I was still feeling awful, and I decided to go back to work. I couldn't even get out of bed, let alone walk to the bathroom. By then I was calling in sick to work because I knew if I didn't, they'd fire me. The next day I stayed home again, and I tried to eat something, but nothing would stay down. That evening I called in sick again, but when I woke up the next morning, I was fine. Ever since that incident I have had strange symptoms, sometimes lasting hours or days at a time, other times only a few minutes. Sometimes I feel dizzy, sometimes I get nauseous, and I also seem to be losing weight at an alarming rate. I don't know what's happening to me, but I think I need help."
Dr. Szozas sits quietly for a moment before responding, "Tell me more about these symptoms."
So I do: "It feels like I'm being pulled in different directions, but I'm not sure which direction I should be going. I can't focus on anything. I feel like I'm moving, but I'm not actually doing anything. There are voices inside my head that I hear, but I can't understand them, and I'm afraid to turn off the TV or radio

My name is ... uh... June." My voice sounds raspy, and I wonder if I've been crying. But then again, maybe this is normal? This doctor will know what to do.
"June?" He asks quizzically, as though he doesn't quite understand what I just said. It makes me feel even more uncomfortable than before.
"Yeah, uhh, June. Uh, sorry, it's hard to talk right now. Maybe later..." I mutter under my breath, while trying to figure out how to explain myself without sounding crazy.
He nods, "OK, June. Just tell me where you are right now."
Oh god, I don't want to say anything bad about being pregnant, or having weird dreams, but I have to get this all out of my system. I can't keep holding back any longer. "Uhm, well, I'm home. In bed, sleeping. I think I'm dreaming, actually. And I had a dream last night, about a baby girl."
Dr. Szozas looks at me expectantly, "A little girl? What color was she?"
I blink, wondering if I heard correctly, but then I realize that I did hear him correctly. I look at him, confused by his question, but I answer anyway, "She was blue. A really bright shade of blue. She looked happy too, and I guess that means I should be happy too, since I am carrying her inside me."
"And the mother?"
"Her hair was blonde. Very pretty. I think I remember seeing pictures of her, but I don't know who she is. I only saw a picture, I didn't meet her face-to-face."
"Do you recognize the father?"
"No, I don't know who that is either. I only met the mom once, briefly, but I got the impression that they were very close. They seemed
