My name is Jondalar."
He nods, then looks back at me, "And why have you chosen to seek help?"
That question makes me uncomfortable again, because there is something inside me that tells me this isn't right, that something is wrong. But I don't know what it is. And I can't explain it. I just want to run away... hide. Instead I say, "It doesn't work anymore."
Dr. Szozas smiles at me reassuringly, "What do you mean 'it doesn't work any more?'"
"I... I mean, I..." I stutter, feeling very embarrassed now. I've never been shy before, but I feel awkward talking to this doctor. It feels strange to talk to anyone about anything personal. I had hoped to keep it private, but apparently I'm not even allowed to do that.
Dr. Szozas sits forward in his chair, leaning toward me, "Let's start with your background. Where did you grow up? What were the circumstances surrounding your birth?"
Oh no, I think, I should have stayed quiet about that. My mother died giving birth to me; she was only twenty-two years old. Her father raised me, but I always felt that he didn't really care about me. I went through a lot of changes when I became an adult: I got married, but it ended badly, and I lost a child, too. Now I live alone with a dog.
I don't remember much from when I was young. I vaguely recall being taken to visit relatives; I believe I lived with them until I started school. I'm not sure if they adopted me or I was born into their family; I wasn't aware that I'd come into the world without parents.
"You mentioned losing a baby. How old was the infant that died?"
"Four months," I answer.
"How long ago would that be

My name is... Gaius Valerius Corvino." And then I pause, wondering if I should mention that I've been seeing a psychiatrist before? But what would be the point? This guy obviously knows all about this stuff already.
He nods slowly, and looks away, and I wait for him to speak again, but he doesn't say anything. The silence becomes uncomfortable, and finally I have to ask, "Is there something wrong?"
"No, not really," he replies, and pauses for another long moment, "Gaius, tell me what brings you here today."
I start talking, describing my situation, how I'm feeling anxious, confused, and frustrated, and how I can't sleep or eat, and how I feel empty inside. I describe how I feel when I try to masturbate, and I don't know if I want to do it anymore because it feels so bad. He listens intently, nodding occasionally, asking questions along the way.
After about twenty minutes I stop talking and wait for his next move.
Finally he speaks, "So you think your problem is related to masturbation?"
"Yes, I'm pretty sure that it is," I reply.
"Do you masturbate regularly?"
"Every day, sometimes twice a day," I admit.
"Have you ever thought about doing other things with your body?"
"Other than sex?" I inquire.
"Right," he responds with a smile.
"Well yes, I suppose I did consider that once, but I didn't really go any further with that idea."
"What was the nature of that fantasy?"
"Oh nothing much, just a little light bondage, maybe a bit of spanking, but I never acted out that particular scenario," I answer.
Dr. Szozas is silent for several moments. I watch his face, waiting to see whether he will react to my admission that I had a

My name is... Aqil..." I pause, and then continue, "...Aqil Kuyuk." I stop again, and ask, "You want to know why I'm here?"
He nods, encouragingly, "Yes please."
So I tell him, starting slowly, describing what happened to me after I left home, and finishing by saying, "That's all I can think of right now. It feels too strange to explain any more than that."
"OK, that sounds fine. And do you have any other symptoms? Any unusual physical changes?"
I shake my head no, not yet. But I feel tired, very tired.
"Any nightmares or visions?"
I shudder, recalling those awful dreams, and say, "No, just bad ones. The worst one was last night. I saw myself falling off a cliff, and there were people trying to save me, but they couldn't reach me fast enough. I was screaming, 'Help! Help!' and nobody heard me. They tried to grab me, but I fell away, further, until I hit a rock face. There was blood everywhere, and I kept sliding down the mountain, and then I woke up. I've been dreaming about this ever since I came to Seattle."
Dr. Szozas looks concerned, "Do you remember the dream clearly?"
I nod yes, "It's vivid. I felt the pain, the terror, I knew I had to get help, but I couldn't move. I thought I would die that way, and I'm afraid to go back to sleep."
Dr. Szozas' eyes widen slightly, "Are you sure that the dream is really a memory, rather than a fantasy?"
I shrug, "I don't know, but I keep having the same nightmare over and over, so I'm pretty certain that I did something terrible to someone once, and I need to find out who it is

My name is Kedan."
He smiles, nods, then asks, "And what brings you to our humble clinic?"
"Well, I had been feeling... weird, since this morning..." I begin hesitantly. "It started out just being a little dizzy, and now I feel nauseous, and very anxious. And I have trouble breathing sometimes. It feels like something is squeezing my chest, and I can't catch my breath. My heart races. It's hard to concentrate. Everything looks different, too bright, or dark, depending on where I am standing. Sometimes I hear voices inside my head, talking to each other, telling me things I don't want to know. It scares me. I've never felt anything like this before."
Dr. Szozas listens attentively, nodding along, taking notes. He glances up briefly, and continues, "Have you ever experienced any problems with your vision? Are there times when you lose focus, or seem unable to comprehend what others say to you? Have you noticed changes in your sense of touch? Do certain foods taste strange? Or smell odd?"
"No, nothing like that," I answer, "but the strangest thing happened today; I was walking across campus, and I heard a voice in my mind saying 'Kedan, get out!' I turned around, but nobody was anywhere near me. I was alone, but I knew I wasn't."
"Hmm, interesting. What about emotions, thoughts? Has anyone said hurtful things to you recently? Made you angry, maybe, or frustrated?"
"Not really, no. I guess I'm not sure if I should tell you about that. I'm afraid that I might be imagining the whole thing. I think I'm having some kind of anxiety attack, but I'm also scared that I'm losing my sanity."
"That's quite a lot to deal with all at once. But let me ask

My name is Aqsa."
He nods, acknowledging this information, and then he asks, "Why did you decide to contact me?"
Oh boy, now what? This guy wants to know all sorts of things about me, and I don't have any answers. My mind goes blank, and I stare back at him. What do I tell him? What does he want to hear? Should I talk about the strange dreams I've been having, or should I just say nothing? I feel paralyzed by fear.
"Well, I had a dream last night...it was a nightmare really..." I begin hesitantly, "...that I was being chased through the woods by people wearing white masks. They were chasing after me, screaming 'Aqsa!' and they grabbed hold of me when I ran into their arms. It was horrible! And I woke up feeling scared and confused, wondering if I'd done something wrong to deserve such punishment. But then I remembered where I was, and realized that the dream wasn't real, but still felt very scary, because I didn't understand what was happening to me.
Dr. Szozas listens intently, his expression growing more serious, "Tell me about the other dreams, the ones that aren't nightmares. Can you remember them clearly enough to describe?"
So I try to recount the details of the strange, surrealistic events that I experienced, but I can't seem to get a handle on it. I am starting to panic again, but I force myself to continue talking, to somehow explain the feelings I'm experiencing.
"...It feels like there's an invisible wall between us, but I can't quite figure out how to break through. You are everywhere, but I'm not sure if you are aware that I'm even here, or if I'm just imagining that. I'm afraid I'm losing touch with reality, I think I may be going crazy, and I need help, but I

My name is Ayla."
He nods, "Ayla. That will do fine." And then he turns to face me again, and asks, "Now tell me, what brings you here today?"
And I begin to talk.

When I finished talking, Dr. Szozas nodded slowly. He didn't interrupt once during the entire time I spoke. When I stopped speaking, he continued to nod slightly, occasionally shaking his head. After a few moments, he said quietly, "So...you say that this 'thing', whatever it is, began two years ago, after you had been married for almost six months? Is that correct?"
"Yes, sir," I replied softly.
"You also indicate that the symptoms have become progressively worse since then. Do you think they might be getting better or worse right now?"
I shook my head. "No, I don't know. They seem to be worsening lately. Maybe they'll get better soon."
Dr. Szozas smiled broadly, "Well, let's hope so, because we need them to improve before we can even consider doing anything else. Can you describe the things that happen when you feel anxious or depressed, please?"
"It starts out small: just a feeling that something isn't quite right, but I push through that, I try to ignore it, but I keep having those feelings that I am not normal. The more I suppress that feeling, the stronger the sensation becomes until I finally give up and admit that I am not OK. I start to worry that maybe I am losing my mind, and that I am going crazy. I worry that I am becoming paranoid, that I am seeing patterns where there are none, and that I am imagining that people are out to hurt me. I am afraid to go out to shop alone, I am constantly checking to see if anyone is watching me; I am always worried that I am being followed

My name is Qalqot."
He nods, and then looks back at me, waiting patiently.   I continue, "And...well, this is really hard to say..."
"Take all the time you need," he urges gently.
Well, that makes sense, I think to myself, and I try again, "Qalqot means 'little duck', right?"
A smile flickers across his face, "Yes, I know what it means."
"It doesn't sound anything like ducks," I offer lamely.
"No? Well, there are many other meanings for the word qalqut, including one meaning 'duck'. But yes, it does refer to ducks, specifically little black-bellied whistling ducks."
Oh, good grief! Now I feel stupid, "Sorry, I didn't realize that. I thought you meant I had a small body or something."
"You do have a very petite figure, but no, I don't mean that at all. Your name is lovely, by the way; it sounds exotic to me. And it suits you perfectly. You are quite a beautiful woman."
What?! What did I just hear? "Thank you," I stammer.
"Now tell me, how can I help you today?"
Dr. Szozas asks, "Do you want to talk about your family history first?"
"Sure," I reply, "But I guess I'm not sure where to start."
Dr. Szozas' brow furrows slightly, "That's understandable; we should probably get to the bottom line first. So, let me ask you a few questions about your childhood. Did you ever go through a phase when you were a child, when you wanted to be a boy, or a girl?"
I blink, "Um, well, I suppose I was a tomboy, but I never felt that strongly about

My name is Ayla."
He smiles again, "Ayla? That's lovely. What brings you to our little clinic?"
I shrug. It sounds silly to say that I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia by one doctor after another, yet none of them seem to understand what I've experienced. But I know they don't get it because there aren't any symptoms that match their diagnosis. In fact, all the doctors just tell me to try to find something else wrong with me, and I do feel better once I leave their offices. They never listen to anything I say, and I always wind up feeling worse. And I can't remember ever being this bad before. I'm scared.
Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair, and rests his hands together across his chest, "Tell me more about your condition."
So I start talking, describing the strange dreams that I've had since I was a child, and then the voices that started when I was eight years old, and how I heard them even though nobody else did. I explain about the episodes where I hear people whispering to each other. Or sometimes I hear things that no human would be able to reproduce. When I described hearing the voice that said "Cerridwen", he interrupted me with his question. "What does Cerridwen sound like to you?"
That's a good question. I think about it for a minute or two, trying to recall the voice that I've heard in my head for the last ten years. I really haven't thought about it much, but I guess I should be able to describe the voice that I hear, right?
"It's a woman, I'm sure of that, but I'm not quite certain if she is a friend or a foe. She speaks very slowly, with a slight lisp, and her voice is high-pitched, almost girlish."
Dr. Szozas nods his head, "

My name is Aqilat." And then I pause, unsure what else to say. The silence stretches between us, and I don't know where to begin. What do I want to talk about? How can I explain this mess inside of me? I feel myself becoming flustered, and I try again, "What should we discuss?"
He smiles reassuringly, "Why don't you tell me what happened to you since you last saw me?"
So I start talking, describing my life before I came to this place, and after I got off the plane in Los Angeles. It feels good to get it all out, and soon I have explained most of my story. He listens intently, nodding occasionally, asking questions now and then, trying to understand exactly what's happening to me. I describe each event, and I think back to when it occurred, reliving the feelings and emotions, remembering the thoughts and images that went through my mind during those times.
Dr. Szozas writes notes on a pad of paper, taking careful note of everything I've said. When I finish telling him about meeting Ati, I realize that there is still more to relate, so I continue, "There was also the time I met that woman...she was beautiful, and she was very sweet..."
When I mention the other woman, I am surprised by the look of concern that crosses his face, and his head jerks up from his writing. I sense that something is wrong, but I'm not sure what. I look at his hands, which are clasped together, resting on his lap, his knuckles white, his fingernails long, painted red.
"Did anything happen that night?" I ask, suddenly concerned.
"Yes, yes, I did. I remember, but I'm not sure if I'm ready to share that part yet. Let me work up to it," he responds.
I nod, but I

My name is... My real name is..." I stop myself before saying 'Kellie', because I don't want anyone else knowing that I have this condition. I clear my throat and continue, "...my name is Kellie."
He nods encouragingly, waiting patiently for me to go on.
"So... um... Well, I've been having trouble sleeping lately, and I can't seem to get off the bed without falling asleep right away. It happens all the time. Sometimes I wake up feeling really tired, even though I only slept five hours or less last night. And then sometimes I feel fine, but after two days I start getting sleepy again, and now I'm just exhausted all the time, and I have trouble concentrating too. I also find myself thinking weird thoughts. I think they're more than normal, they're disturbing, but I'm not sure what to do about them. They keep coming back to me, and I'm afraid that if something doesn't change soon, I'll lose control completely and become an insomniac and a sleepwalker. Is there anything I should know about this?"
Dr. Szozas responds thoughtfully, "Tell me what makes you think that this is happening? What symptoms are you experiencing, and when did you begin noticing them?"
This is the part I was most worried about; I didn't want to give the wrong impression, so I tried to be very careful. I started by describing the things I was doing, but I knew I was being vague, so I had to fill in the blanks with words, which I hoped were correct.
"Well, I was feeling pretty good until recently, but I've noticed that I am losing focus, especially when I try to concentrate on reading or writing. I can't stay focused, I get distracted easily, and I end up staring at the page for a long time before I realize I haven't read a word I was supposed to.
