Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Dawn Hartman.\" My voice quivers slightly. \"And...well...\"\nHe smiles again, this time with genuine warmth and understanding, \"Tell me what brings you here today?\"\nI pause again, then I tell him: \"...Well, um, I've been experiencing some problems recently, and uhm...\" The words seem to slip out of me.\n\"Do you have any family? Friends? A partner? Children?\" he asks gently.\n\"No,\" I say softly, feeling tears begin to form in my eyes, \"Just myself.\"\nDr. Szozas nods, and pats the cushion beside him, \"Why don't we start there?\" he suggests.\nSo I move closer to him, and I lie back onto the couch, facing him. He looks at me intently, and I feel his gaze penetrating deep inside me. I try to hold his eye contact, but I find myself turning away, embarrassed by the emotion that is beginning to well up within me.\nAfter a moment or two of silence, he speaks quietly, \"You know, if you'd rather talk to a male doctor, I can refer you to one right now.\"\n\"No!\" I exclaim, shaking my head vigorously, trying to hide the fact that I'm crying.\nDr. Szozas sits forward, leaning into me, \"Dawn, I want to help you, please let me do that.\"\nI nod weakly, wiping the tears from my cheeks with the backs of my hands. I turn to face him once more, but I am unable to meet his eyes.\n\"Can I ask what brought you to me?\" he inquires.\nI swallow hard, and I force the words out, \"It's my birthday next week, and I'm planning to go out with some friends, but something is wrong with me; it feels like everything is happening too fast. It doesn't seem real. And I",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Lauren, and...\" I stop myself, realizing that this may seem silly to say after only meeting him today, but I continue, \"...and I've had some strange experiences lately.\"\nHe nods, encouragingly, \"That's quite normal, don't worry about it.\"\n\"Strange...experiences?\" I ask, still feeling unsure.\n\"Well, let's start with the most obvious one: where do you work? What did you study before college? Have you ever been married? Do you have any children?\" he asks, beginning to write things down in a little notebook that sits next to his computer keyboard.\n\"No kids yet, not even engaged,\" I answer honestly, then add, \"I'm 24 years old now, I graduated last year from UCLA, majoring in Psychology.\"\n\"Psychology? That's interesting,\" he muses, \"What drew you to that particular field?\"\nI pause again, thinking about what I want to tell him. He's such an open person, and I feel safe telling him anything about myself. \"I really enjoy people, especially human interaction, and I wanted to help others get through their problems.\"\n\"And that led you into psychology?\" he inquires.\n\"Yes, I guess so. It seemed like the right fit.\"\n\"Interesting,\" he responds, writing something else down.\n\"So...what kind of 'strange' experience can I expect when I come to see you tomorrow?\" I'm trying to be light-hearted about the whole thing, but I know that I'm nervous about being honest with him.\n\"It depends, we'll talk about that when I see you. Now, I'm going to give you a few tests, just to see if there are any underlying issues that might be causing these symptoms. Please, relax and take a deep breath. I'm going to touch a spot that is very sensitive to you, and I need to",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Elizabeth, Elizabeth Jones.\"\nHe nods, and continues waiting patiently.\nSo I continue, \"And I came because...\" My face falls a little, \"...because I think I might have been... possessed by something evil.\" I say this last part quietly, almost ashamedly. I don't want to admit to anyone else what happened, especially not to someone who I've just met. But Dr. Szozas does not seem surprised, or upset, instead he simply asks, \"Do you know where it went?\"\nI shake my head, \"No, I don't really remember much after I looked through the web site. It was all very strange, and scary, and confusing.\"\nDr. Szozas smiles again, \"That sounds familiar. Tell me more about that.\"\nIt was odd talking to Dr. Szozas. We didn't talk about anything serious or deep, we talked about things like movies I had seen (he was quite knowledgeable), music (he seemed to enjoy classic rock), food (his favorite foods were Chinese). And when our conversation ended, I realized that I hadn't even asked his age.\nAfterwards, I thanked him for seeing me and leaving, but I couldn't help thinking that I would come back if I needed to.\nA few days later, I received an email from him saying that I should come in. This time I took the subway into Manhattan rather than driving, and I arrived at the same building. When I walked into the lobby I saw that the place wasn't nearly as fancy as the other office that I'd visited. There weren't any paintings on the walls, no sculptures, no carpets. The only thing that stood out to me was the sign that said \"Szokos \u0026 Associates\".\nWhen I reached the office, the receptionist greeted me with a smile, \"Hello, welcome to the office, can I help you with anything?\"\n\"Yes,\" I",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Sarah Smith.\" My heart pounds inside my chest as I continue, \"And I've been experiencing strange dreams, nightmares, since last night.\" The words tumble out of me, and then I pause, waiting for his reaction.\nHe looks pensively across his desk at me, nodding slowly, \"Yes...yes, I can certainly understand that...\" He pauses again, \"...that's quite a story, Ms. Smith.\" He smiles gently at me, \"It sounds very interesting, I would love to hear more about this dream world you find yourself in.\"\nOh my God! I think to myself. He knows what happened to me? And he wants to help?! I feel a rush of excitement wash through me, and I tell him all about the nightmare world I had visited yesterday.\nDr. Szozas listens intently to my tale, interrupting only once to ask me a question or two. I answer each one fully, carefully choosing my words to ensure that nothing is left out. At the end of our conversation, we have established that there is indeed something unusual happening with me.\nAfter I finish telling him about the dream world, I get up off the couch and walk to his desk, where I pick up the phone, \"May I call you back tomorrow morning?\" I say, \"To schedule a time, I'll need to know a few things about you, and about the situation, and I'd like to talk with your doctor before I decide if I want to go any further with this. I don't want to waste anyone's time if I'm not a good fit. I'm sorry, but I'm really just trying to figure this whole thing out right now.\"\n\"Of course, Sarah, please do that. I look forward to speaking with you. You are most welcome here, anytime. I hope to see you soon. Goodnight!\"\nI hang up the phone and return to the sofa, sitting next to",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Elizabeth A., and I'm here because I have been experiencing... changes.\" My voice falters slightly, I can feel myself blushing, which makes me even more embarrassed. I've never had anyone listen to me this intently before. It feels uncomfortable, yet strangely comforting too.\nHe nods slowly, encouragingly, \"Yes, please continue.\"\nSo I do. \"For starters, there is something wrong with my face...\" I say, feeling foolish saying such things aloud. \"It looks different now than it did yesterday, or last week. The shape of my nose, the length of my lips, the color of my hair, the size of my breasts. They all seem to change day by day, sometimes hour by hour.\" I pause, then add, \"And they don't just stay changed, they get bigger, or smaller, or longer, or shorter. Sometimes one part gets bigger while another shrinks, and I'm not sure what that means either. And then other times I wake up and they are completely normal again. But most often, they aren't normal anymore after I go to sleep at night. Afterward, they look strange and unnatural again, until the next morning when they revert back to their previous state.\" I look away from his gaze, unable to meet his eyes.\nDr. Szozas leans forward a bit, \"Elizabeth, I know this sounds very confusing to you, but I think I understand where you are coming from. You are having a sort of spontaneous transformation, a metamorphosis, if you will. Your body is changing, adapting, and adjusting itself, as though it is trying to find its proper place in the world. Have you ever heard the term 'hormone imbalance'?\"\nI shake my head, \"No. I didn't realize that was the cause. I thought it was a psychological thing.\"\n\"Well, I believe that is the case,\" he says with a nod",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Jennifer Smith.\" I pause, then add, \"I've been having some problems lately...\"\nHe nods encouragingly, waiting patiently, \"Go ahead... tell me all about it.\"\nSo I do: \"It started last year, when I went to college in New York City. I had never really experienced anything this big before, and there were lots of things that were different than back home in Georgia, too much stuff to list off now. It wasn't easy adjusting, but I met a lot of new people, and I learned a ton. But something strange happened while I was away, and it has continued ever since I got back to Atlanta.\"\nDr. Szozas listens intently, nodding occasionally. When I finish speaking, he asks, \"What exactly have you noticed?\"\nThis is where I begin listing the symptoms I've developed, which include insomnia, nightmares, inability to concentrate, bouts of anger and anxiety, paranoia, fearfulness, loss of appetite, depression, and the occasional bout of crying jags. He writes notes, asking questions periodically, \"Have you considered seeing a psychologist? Or perhaps a psychiatrist?\"\n\"Yes, I saw one after I returned from school, but she couldn't help me. She said that I was fine, but I'm not sure if I believe her, or if I trust her. I don't know if I'm crazy, or if I'm just sick or what.\"\nThe doctor responds, \"You seem to be a very bright young woman who is trying to deal with a difficult situation. Perhaps you should try talking to your parents about it. I can give them a call, if they are willing to talk with me about their daughter's problem. In the meantime, we'll continue to monitor your progress, and if necessary I will arrange another appointment to help us get to the bottom of this mystery.\"\nWe agree to meet again in a few weeks, and I leave his office feeling",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Annabelle Williams.\"\nHe nods and smiles, \"And where do you live?\"\n\"I don't have a home right now... I've been staying with friends...\"\n\"Ah yes, you mentioned that before. And what brings you to this clinic? Why did you choose us specifically?\"\n\"Well, after seeing the website, I thought I'd give it a try. I had heard good things about the place, and they seemed pretty open minded, especially since they specialize in unusual cases. It sounds like a great opportunity.\"\nDr. Szozas grins again, \"Excellent answer! Thank you. Now let's get started then, shall we?\"\nWe talk for hours. The interview went very smoothly; Dr. Szozas asked questions about my life, family history, work history, etc., and I answered them all truthfully. At one point he even got up and walked back to the kitchen area to retrieve a glass of water. When he returned, he sat next to me on the sofa, and continued our conversation while sipping his drink.\nDr. Szozas listened intently to everything I said, nodding occasionally when I spoke. He also made notes throughout the session; I was surprised at the amount of information that he was able to collect about me, just by asking a few simple questions.\nFinally, at the end of the hour-long interview, he stood to leave, \"Annabelle, I can tell that you are a bright young woman with a lot to offer the world. I'm sure that there are many opportunities out there that would be perfect for you. I will be keeping a file on you, and I'll be contacting you to schedule a follow-up appointment. I hope that you find the help that you need. I'm sure that I'll be calling you soon!\"\nAs I left, I felt a little nervous, but a big smile came to my face; I",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Bethany, and...\" I pause, trying to think of something unique enough to say...\nHe smiles again, \"Bethany? That sounds very familiar.\"\nI feel myself blush, and then I go ahead and tell him, \"You may have heard of me: 'the girl who escaped from hell'. It was on the news last year.\"\nHe nods, and asks, \"And why did you want to talk to me?\"\nI clear my throat, and try to find the words, \"Well, I guess because I don't know what's happening to me, and I need help figuring things out.\"\nDr. Szozas looks up at me, and there is a calmness about him that tells me he knows exactly what is happening to me, \"OK, let's start with an examination, shall we?\"\nI nod, and I can already feel the cool touch of his hands as they explore my body, starting with my face, moving downwards to my neck, shoulders, back, arms, legs, waist, stomach, breasts, and finally my feet. I cannot believe this is actually happening to me. My heart pounds with excitement, \"This will only take a few minutes, I promise,\" he states, as he palpates my breast tissue with his thumbs, feeling them through the fabric of my blouse. I shiver with pleasure at his touch, and I close my eyes to enjoy the sensation.\n\"That feels nice,\" I murmur, and I open my eyes to look at him.\n\"Thank you,\" he replies with a smile, and I am surprised at the intensity of his gaze as he studies me.\nI look away, embarrassed by his attention, but I am also curious to see his reaction to the rest of me.\nHe stands up and walks over to the door, \"Let me get some privacy screens installed, just a minute please.\"\nAs soon as the door closes behind",
