=== Prompt ========================================
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "

=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Holo."
He nods back, waiting patiently for me to continue, "And...?"
It feels strange to tell this stranger anything personal about myself, but I can hardly keep quiet after having been given such a warm welcome. My throat tightens up as I start talking, "Well, um..."
Dr. Szozas smiles kindly at me, and then leans forward, placing both elbows on his knees, "You've never had trouble speaking before, have you? You don't stutter or slur your words?"
What a relief! It really does feel good to know that I'm not crazy, that I haven't lost all sense of self because of something wrong inside me. "No, sir," I answer honestly.
"So what brings you to me today?" he asks.
I think hard about how best to explain things to him, "Um, well..." I begin, "It started when I got home last night. A lot happened while I was away, so I didn't sleep very well, and then when I woke up I felt tired again, but I couldn't go to work..."
Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding along with me, "Go on."
"But I went to bed early that night, and I slept right through until morning. I just kept waking up with the feeling that I hadn't gotten enough rest the day before. And I noticed that I wasn't hungry at breakfast, either, but I ate anyway. And I remember that I went to the bathroom three times that morning. I also remembered that I took a nap that afternoon, but I still ended up sleeping through dinner. I knew that I should eat, but I just wanted to lie there. I felt sick, but I thought that I'd get better if I rested more. But I fell asleep anyway, even though I shouldn't have. I felt terrible that I did that to Mr. Lawrence. I apologized to

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Myne."
He nods, then asks, "And where did you hear about me?"
"On the internet," I answer honestly. It was just too good to pass up.
"Ahh...well, there's a lot of information online, isn't there? And we don't have much time today, so let's get right to business. Why do you think you've been feeling this way lately?"
What does one say to such a question? How can one explain oneself to another person? A few minutes ago, I was confused by myself, now I feel lost. There were moments when I felt fine, and moments when I didn't know what was wrong with me. But I knew something wasn't quite right when I had trouble sleeping last night.
"...It started after I went back home, and I couldn't sleep..." I said finally.
"Did anything happen when you got home?" He asked, leaning forward intently.
"No, nothing really happened. We ate dinner together, talked about our day, that sort of thing."
Dr. Szozas nodded, "So, I assume things are pretty normal between you two?"
"Yes, very normal. At least, I thought they were. I was hoping that once I was back at school again everything would go back to the way it was before. I was thinking that maybe I was imagining it all. I was trying to convince myself that I was being stupid or that I was getting worked up because I was homesick or something. I was afraid that if I admitted to anyone that I was having a hard time, that I might not be able to come to class anymore."
I was surprised to find that I was telling the truth. I was scared that I'd be kicked out of the academy if I was unable to keep up with the work.
But Dr. Szozas is nodding along with my story. "...Hmm, I

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Holo."
He nods, then asks again, "And why are you here?"
"Because..." I pause, unsure what to say. Should I tell him? Or should I just get right to the point? "I think there might be something wrong with me."
He smiles gently, "Oh, dear."
There is nothing else to add to this statement. It's all true. I feel empty inside, and I don't know where to start explaining myself. My mind feels...empty. Like I have no idea what I want anymore. What I need.
Then Dr. Szozas puts one finger to his chin, thinking hard. He looks back at me, "Holo, do you remember when we met before?"
That was six months ago. A beautiful autumn day, and I was walking through the woods by the lake near our village. The leaves were turning red, yellow, orange. I had been spending time alone ever since the death of my father, and sometimes I would go off into the forest to collect mushrooms or berries. This was when I found him.
A young boy with brown hair, dressed only in a raggedy shirt and pants. His face was dirty, but his smile brightened the whole world. We sat together under the trees, and I fed him the bread I'd brought along. I asked if he wanted to play a game I knew called "Piggy Bank". I won, but I didn't care. I liked being with the little boy.
We played many games after that, until the sun began its descent toward the horizon. I said goodbye, promising to visit again soon, but I never did.
Dr. Szozas stares at me with a thoughtful expression, "Do you remember that boy?"
"Yes," I answer without hesitation.
"What happened to that boy?"
"Nothing good," I reply softly.
Dr. Szozas'

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Holo." And then I tell him all that happened since we last saw each other. When I finish speaking, there is silence between us. It feels awkward, even though this isn't really any different than usual doctor visits. I feel like I've said too much already. What can I say? That I don't want anyone else to know about what's happening to me? No way.
He nods slowly, "That's quite a story," he remarks quietly, which makes me smile because I find his tone calming somehow. He looks at me again, "So...you're saying that after reading the website, you felt compelled to come to me?"
I nod yes.
"And you came to me right away without making an appointment?"
Again I nod.
"Hmm..." He furrows his brows, "Do you think that might have something to do with the fact that I specialize in unusual cases?"
This time I shake my head no.
"No idea," he muses aloud, "But if it does, I'd recommend against coming to me straight off the bat."
I nod once more.
"What did the website say exactly?" he asks.
"It said that I need help, and that I should consult with a psychiatrist. I didn't read very far into the site, just enough to decide that I wanted to come to you."
"Ahh, I see."
Silence falls, and I am struck by the intensity of his gaze. I look back at him, confused, and he smiles at me, "Holo, I'm a psychiatrist. I'm not a normal one, I'm a specialist. I'm a doctor who specializes in mental health. But I am also a human being, with a heart. I'm a good person, a kind man, I hope that comes through to you. I believe that I can be a friend to you, a trusted confidant

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Holo."
He smiles again, "And what do you want?"
This question catches me off guard, and I fumble a bit before responding, "Well...what does one normally ask such questions? What would I expect to hear back from this visit?"
Szozas laughs, "Oh, nothing special. Just tell me what's bothering you."
That sounds easy enough, and I try to explain, "It started with an argument between myself and another merchant yesterday. I wasn't able to sleep last night because I kept thinking about it, and then today..." I trail off there, unsure where to go next.
Dr. Szozas nods, "You mentioned a merchant arguing with you. Do you have any idea who that might be?"
I shake my head, "No. It was just an argument. No punches thrown or anything like that."
"Hmm...well, let's start with something simple: did anyone else overhear the exchange?"
Again, I think about that for a moment, "Um...no. I don't think so."
"Good. Now, if you were to say that the other person was being unreasonable, how would you describe their behavior?"
I stare at the doctor blankly, trying to remember the details of the argument.
"Was the other party older than you by more than five years?"
"Huh?!"
The suddenness of the question leaves me flustered, but I manage to answer, "Yes, they were much older than me, though not quite twenty-five yet."
The doctor chuckles softly, "So you've been taking care of them since they were little, right?"
I nod.
"What kind of work are they doing now?"
I furrow my brow, and I can't figure out how to answer that.
The doctor continues, "If I had to guess, I'd say that the old man is

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Myne." The moment I say it, something feels off, and I find myself wondering if this is really me talking. I feel like I should have been more cautious, but I can't stop now... "And I've heard about Dr. Szozas..."
"That's fine, don't worry about formalities, just tell me what brought you to me today. You said 'unusual case,' did you?"
It took several minutes before I managed to get all my thoughts together enough to speak. When I finally got them out, they were shaky and halting. It felt like I was speaking to a stranger. But somehow I knew that I needed to trust him. And then, after another long pause, I continued, "...I'm suffering from delusions, and I want to know if I'm mentally ill."
He looks at me curiously, "You're not being treated by any doctors? Do you work or study with other people?"
"No, I'm alone, except for Holo."
Dr. Szozas nods slowly, "So you came to me because you believe that there is nothing wrong with you physically, but you think that you are sick in the head?"
I nod, "Yes. I thought maybe I was having trouble sleeping, but when I looked online about it, I found a lot of strange stuff about mental health issues, and I started thinking that I might be going crazy."
After a short silence, I continue, "But when I went to the doctor, I realized that I was right about the sleep thing, but that doesn't explain the rest. I still don't understand. I had a dream last night that I was a prisoner, locked up in a dark room with no windows, and I couldn't escape. I woke up crying, and I wanted to go to the police but I was scared. I didn't know who I could talk to about it, so I decided to come

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Enek Thordun."
He nods, then asks, "And what brings you here today?"
"Well..." I begin hesitantly, "...my life...has been very difficult recently, and I have had trouble sleeping, and I find myself having difficulty concentrating. It feels almost like there is something pressing against my mind, trying to get inside me. And when I think about it, I feel like I've lost control of my thoughts."
Dr. Szozas tilts his head slightly, his expression grave. "So, what do you want to talk about?"
"It started last month. When I got this job, I thought it would give me more freedom than ever before, but instead I just felt trapped by it all. My work was demanding, and I didn't know how much longer I'd be able to keep up with it. I don't even remember when things began to change. But I started feeling depressed, and I couldn't sleep. The other day I woke up early and decided to go to bed earlier than usual, but I ended up staying awake until late at night. I fell asleep with the lights off because I was too tired to turn them back on. I can't stop thinking about that incident, and I can't shake the feeling that I did something wrong, but I'm not sure what. I tried to tell my boss about it but I don't really understand what I'm saying to him either. I can't focus anymore, I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing or not. I'm afraid to leave the house, but I'm also scared to stay home alone. I'm not sure if I should be going to church or not; I'm afraid that I might say the wrong thing again. I'm worried about the future; I'm afraid I'll lose the company I have now if I quit, but I'm equally terrified to stay. I don't know who

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Myne."
He nods and smiles gently, "And what brings you here?"
"Well..." I say hesitantly, "It started this morning...when I woke up, I had been dreaming something strange."
He listens attentively, nodding occasionally, "Go ahead."
So I tell him about my dreams, about the things I saw while asleep, and then about what happened after waking up. About being chased by people, about running away, about falling off a cliff. And finally, about meeting Lawrence and getting caught up in all the trouble. As I talk, Dr. Szozas keeps asking questions, sometimes interrupting to clarify details or ask more detailed follow ups. It feels good to have someone listening to me, even if they aren't really paying attention. After I finish telling him about everything, I look up at him expectantly, wondering whether I've done alright. He just sits there silently for a moment, and then speaks up, "Mmm, yes, that sounds very similar to other cases we've seen before. I think it would be best to start with an examination, followed by a few sessions of therapy."
"But..."
Dr. Szozas holds up his hands to silence me, "Let's not get too far ahead of ourselves yet. You can go home now, but I'll need to check with the doctor to schedule a time to meet with you again later today."
As I stand, I feel quite disheartened at the thought that I might not be able to continue with the treatment right away. But he stands, puts his hand out, and pulls me back into his chair, "Don't worry about that. We'll figure out the rest when the time comes. Go on home; I don't want to keep you any longer than I must."
With that, I leave the office feeling much better. I'm sure that I will be able to find some way to

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Holo." My hands are shaking just slightly, and I feel awkward being this close to such a powerful man.
He nods, "And what brings you here today?"
I think back to the message board post I saw earlier, and then continue, "Well...my friend sent me there..."
"Your friend? Who might that be?"
I give him her name, which makes him smile again, "So she suggested you contact me because you were having problems with your sex life?"
Now I blush furiously, embarrassed by my own lack of sophistication. What a stupid reason to seek help. It's embarrassing enough that I would have come here without even knowing the problem myself. The embarrassment only gets worse when I realize that I can't find any words to say.
Dr. Szozas laughs heartily, "Don't worry about it. Just tell me exactly what happened."
I try to get the story out, but I don't want to talk about the details. Instead, I describe the situation that led up to me coming to his office, and how I was feeling at the time.
When I finish talking, Dr. Szozas sits quietly for several moments before responding, "Hmhm. Well, I guess I'll start with the basics: we need to determine if you are suffering from a mental disorder or not. There are two ways to do that, the first is to use the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM), the other is to perform a clinical interview. I'm not sure if the web site gave you all the information that you needed, but if they did, I'd suggest that you go with the DSM method. You won't be able to decide if you are or are not mentally ill based on the results of the interview alone, but the interviews are more thorough than the standard questionnaires. I'm going to ask a few questions now, but please answer honestly. This will allow us to determine

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Myne."
He nods, "And what brings you to see me?"
Well, this is where things get interesting. It would seem that I've been chosen by God to speak with the great doctor himself. That thought makes me feel all giddy inside. But then again, I'm not sure if there really is such a being as God.
"Doctor...my mind..." I say slowly, "...is playing tricks on me. I don't know what's happening to me."
"What do you mean? What exactly does happen to you?"
"It feels like my body is changing, growing bigger. And I can hear voices in my head. They tell me different stories sometimes, and they give advice about what I should do next. Sometimes I just wake up one day and I have a headache or something else is wrong with me. I can't remember how long it's lasted now. Maybe three days, maybe four. Or even longer than that."
"How big are we talking? Are you saying you're getting taller?"
"No, not yet. Not quite yet, anyway. I guess I'm still pretty small compared to other people. Just a little shorter than average height for girls."
"So far, you haven't changed much physically. Have you noticed any changes to your face, hair, breasts, anything along those lines?"
"...Not really. I don't think I'd be able to pick them out if I saw myself in the mirror."
Dr. Szozas leans back and folds his arms across his chest, "That sounds like an extremely unusual case. The way I understand it, you're experiencing a sort of mental disorder, which is causing physical symptoms. Your brain is telling your body to change its shape to accommodate the thoughts that are running through it. This is known as somatoparaphrenia, a condition that I believe is fairly rare. You'll find that most cases
