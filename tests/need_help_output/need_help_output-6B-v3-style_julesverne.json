Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

Tell me more?\"\nSo I do, and tell him what has transpired since we met two days ago. He listens attentively, asking questions only when necessary, until finally, I finish speaking.  Then he smiles again, and says, \"You know, there are many ways to sleep better than others. It depends entirely on our state of mind. For example, if you had a nightmare, or were frightened by something, would you prefer to wake up, or go back to bed? Do you want to return to your old life, or live in a new one? What are your dreams telling you?\"\nDreams? My dreams? I don't remember any dreams lately, but I suppose they're still inside me somewhere. I shrug, \"Well, I guess I'd rather stay in bed.\"\n\"Good choice. That means that you have a subconscious desire to remain asleep. A dreamless sleep is the best kind of sleep possible. You mustn't worry about anything, not even the fact that you haven't slept well yet. Just let your body rest, relax, and heal itself. In time, you'll be able to get the deep, refreshing, uninterrupted sleep that you need. And, when that happens, your whole world will change for the better. Your friends and family members will also benefit from this healing process.\"\nI nod, but I'm not sure I really understand what Dr. Szozas is saying. I'm afraid that I might be missing some important piece of information that I'm supposed to be picking up on. I'm nervous, but I try to keep calm, and I say, \"But I",
