Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him.

Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

Describe your symptoms to me.\"\nSo I describe my episodes, how they feel, the sensations, the emotions, the thoughts, and the memories that seem to come unbidden. He listens intently, nodding along. When I finish, he leans back in his chair, hands clasped together on his lap, elbows resting against the arms of the chair, and looks at me thoughtfully.\nAfter several minutes of silence, he finally speaks up, \"It sounds like there are multiple components to your condition. How would you categorize them?\"\nI consider the question, and I answer, \"Well, the most common one is memory loss. But when that happens, other things happen too: feelings of anxiety, panic attacks, confusion, and sometimes anger. There are also times where I just get lost. And, uhm, I'm not sure if I should call it a 'side effect' or not, but I'm having trouble sleeping lately.\"\nDr. Szozas sits forward and places his fingertips to his lips, thinking carefully.
