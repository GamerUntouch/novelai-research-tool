He looked dangerous, too, because he was very muscular, and I think he might have been a bodybuilder or something similar. But he wasn't scary, not in a 'bad guy' way, just sort of intimidating.

Words that seemed important, perhaps?\"\n\"Yeah. Just one word, repeated a few times: 'Liar.' I don't understand what that means.

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

Have you been experiencing anything different recently?\"\nI nod, and tell him, \"Yeah, actually. My dreams seem more vivid than usual, which can be hard to describe, but they feel very real...\"\nDr. Szozas gives me a thoughtful look, and after a moment or two, he responds, \"That sounds right. Let's talk about what happens when you wake up: Do you remember your dreams clearly?\"\nI frown a little, thinking back to my last few nightmares. I don't really remember them all too well, but I think I recall having one where I was flying through space, or something along those lines. It wasn't a pleasant dream at all.\n\"Not perfectly,\" I admit, \"but I've had the same recurring nightmare ever since I started seeing you.\"\nDr. Szozas raises an eyebrow at me, and inquires further, \"What is the nature of the dream?\"\nSo I recount the details, telling him about the flying spaceship, the strange alien creatures, the sense that I was being pulled into a black hole that I couldn't escape from. I also mention the feeling that I am losing control of myself; I keep getting angry, and frustrated, but I don't know why.\nWhen I finish the story, Dr. Szozas sits quietly, rubbing his chin with his index finger. He ponders the situation for quite a while before responding.\nFinally, he says, \"It is possible that the dreams are a symptom of PTSD, caused by the events that you described.
