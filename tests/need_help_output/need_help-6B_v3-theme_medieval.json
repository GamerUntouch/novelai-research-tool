Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Kristin Erlendsson.\"\nHe nods, and then he sits back in his chair, folding his hands together on top of each other. He looks at me expectantly, waiting for me to continue.\nSo I tell him my story: How I became interested in computers by accident when I was nine years old, and discovered programming languages; how I got hooked on web design; how I got into writing code, learning HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and finally Python; how I started designing websites professionally; how I moved onto developing mobile apps... and now, I've been working on my own projects since last year, trying to get them published. My dad had always wanted to write a book or something along those lines, but he never did anything about it because of all our financial problems. But after I graduated college, I thought I'd do it myself.\nBut then I got depressed. All my friends were getting married and having babies, while I was stuck with this huge student loan debt. And even worse, I didn't have any prospects of finding a job that would pay enough to cover the bills. I tried dating, but nothing worked out.\nAnd one day I just couldn't stand it anymore. I walked into the bathroom, and I took off my clothes and looked into the mirror. I saw that I wasn't pretty, I had no breasts, no hips, no ass; I was just a big blob of a girl with flat chested shoulders and skinny arms. I hated the way I looked; I hated the fact that I had no life. I don't know where I went wrong, but I just felt empty inside.\nThat night I decided to end it; I bought a bottle of pills, and I swallowed the whole thing. I woke up the next morning, feeling fine; I still had the money I spent to buy the pills, so I figured I must be alright.\nAfter that I stopped taking",
