He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",

What exactly do you think is happening? Can you give us any details or examples that might help us understand your concerns better?\"\r\n\"Well... It all began when I was watching television one night. The news station had a story on child abuse, and the reporter mentioned that there were more than 1 million children being abused by their parents each year. I found myself thinking, 'That can't possibly be true.' But the statistics seemed to support her claim. And I wondered, if she knew the truth, would the government still allow such things to happen?'\r\nI continue, \"Then I thought, 'What if the government knows the truth, and they just don't care?'\"   I paused, and continued, \"And I remembered the day when my mother died. I remember the smell of the hospital room, and the sound of the sirens outside. I remember the sadness I felt at the loss of my mom.

I've never really been able to trust people since my dad died, and I feel a sense of helplessness when I try to form relationships with other people.

State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

He listens intently, asking questions along the way, until I get to the part where we broke up. At this point I feel myself becoming emotional, and I break down crying, sobbing loudly, \"It just wasn't working out anymore. We were fighting all the time.

It started when I asked him for a divorce, because I couldn't stand being in the same house as him any longer. He called me a bitch, and a cunt, and a stupid slut, and a whore, and a cumdumpster, and a cocktease. I guess I deserved that, because I cheated on him. I can admit that now, and I'm sorry for doing it, I really am. I would never do anything like that again, I swear on my life. I've been trying to figure out what went wrong between us, and I keep coming up empty-handed. He won't even talk to me. I sent him a letter, and I waited a week for a reply, and I got nothing. I haven't heard from him since then, and that's when I decided I needed to seek help.\"\nDr. Szozas nods, and responds, \"I understand, and I'm glad to hear that you are taking steps",

I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

  "prompt": "I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",

It started with me getting stuck in traffic during rush hour, and then after work, while I was walking home from the subway station, I had this sudden wave of panic, followed by fear that something terrible would happen to me.\" \nHe nods. \"OK, go ahead,\" he responds calmly.\n\"So I went back to my apartment, which took about thirty minutes. While I was there, I felt anxious again, and decided to call my boyfriend, whom I haven't seen in two weeks. But when I called him, I got nothing but static. I tried calling a couple more times, and still, nothing. Finally I just gave up, because I didn't want to waste any more time. I thought maybe I should try to get a hotel room for the night, or at least a place where I can stay for a few days.\r\nBut I don't have much money, and I couldn't afford a single-night stay at a cheap motel, or even a mid-range hotel for a day or two. And I really need to talk to my boyfriend. I know I'll feel better once I do.\"\r\nDr. Szozas asks me to elaborate. I tell him what happened next, and I explain how I ended up on the street, and I start crying and shaking. I sob, and I cry for a long time, until I finally calm myself down and I stop. I wipe my face dry, and I say, \"I'm sorry, I'm not really feeling very well. I think I need to leave now. Thank you for seeing me today.\" I stand up and walk out the door.\r\nDr. Szozas is confused and upset. He tries to reach out to me, to console me, to reassure me, to comfort me. I turn my head away, and I keep on moving. I",
