  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is...  .\" And then I stop talking because I don't know what else to say. I feel naked before this man, and I wish I had something more substantial than just my name to tell him. It feels so strange to have such a powerful person staring at me, waiting for me to continue.\nHe looks back at me, and after a momentary pause, he continues, \"And why are you here?\"\nIt sounds so formal, so clinical, like we are both doctors and patients in a hospital. I can hear myself stuttering, trying to find the words that will explain myself properly. I try again: \"Well, um... I've been having problems with my memory lately...\"\nDr. Szozas sits forward, \"What do you remember? What happened yesterday? Where were you last night?\"\n\"Yesterday? Well... I woke up late morning today, and went to work. I ate lunch there, and came home, and watched TV until bedtime. That was all I did yesterday.\"\nDr. Szozas nods slowly, \"And where were you between 3pm and 8pm yesterday afternoon?\"\nNow I get nervous; I haven't really thought about that. I think hard about the answer, but I can't come up with anything. I'm not sure if I even left the apartment that day. I look at the doctor quizzically.\n\"You didn't go out at all yesterday?\"\nI shake my head no, but I'm not sure if I should be telling the truth.\nThe psychiatrist smiles at me, and I relax a little bit. He doesn't seem angry or disappointed, but rather curious. I'm not sure what to expect. I'm still a bit embarrassed by the fact that I don't know the answers to his questions, but I'm also relieved that I'm not a criminal, that I am indeed innocent.\n\"Why are you so afraid, are you worried about",

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

When I have finished speaking, he nods, and asks questions about my life before all of this started happening to me. What was I doing? Who was I hanging out with? How did I feel during those times? It was easy to tell him what happened to me, because the memories came back easily. But when I tried to recall things after that, they just didn't seem real.
