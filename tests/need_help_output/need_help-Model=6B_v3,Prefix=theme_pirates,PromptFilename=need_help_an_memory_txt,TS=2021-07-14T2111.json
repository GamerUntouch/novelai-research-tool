He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",

She died when I was five years old.\nHe nods, and then asks, \"What do you want to talk about?\"\nI start talking, trying to organize my thoughts. My story starts by telling him that I've been having problems since I was very young. I think it started when I was four or five, but I can't really remember. \nI tell him that I have trouble sleeping, nightmares mostly, and that I get depressed when things don't go my way. Sometimes I feel like crying, but other times I just feel angry. I also say that sometimes I feel scared or anxious, and that I often lose my temper.\nDr. Szozas listens intently, and writes notes on a pad of paper. I continue, \"Sometimes I hear voices, and I have dreams where I'm being chased, and I try to run away, and I end up in a dark room, a scary place. I never know what will happen next, and I wake up feeling terrified and confused. I need help, I need advice. I need to know what to do, and I don't know if I should keep doing this, I'm afraid to stop. I'm not sure if I'm crazy, and I'm not sure if I'll ever be normal. I need help!\"\nI cry, and I shake, and I ask for his help. He looks at me, and his eyes are kind, and I sense compassion. He tells me that I seem like a good kid, and that I deserve a chance. He tells me that I am not crazy, and that I shouldn't let anyone else decide what I am. He gives me hope, and I feel better, and I thank him for his time.\nI leave his office feeling a little more hopeful, and I walk out into the sunshine.\nThat",

  "prompt": "I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",
  "result": "My full name is Baret Keith Etington.\" I pause, and then continue, \"Well, actually my real name is Bartlett, but everyone calls me Baret because they think I sound cool, which I don't mind at all.\"   I smile at him, hoping that this will alleviate any concerns.\nHe smiles back, but doesn't say anything right away, instead just staring at me intently. I feel uncomfortable, almost like he can read my thoughts somehow. I clear my throat, \"So... what do you want to know?\"\n\"Bartlett...\" he starts slowly, and pauses for a moment before continuing, \"...tell me about your relationship with your father.\"\nI stare at the carpeted floor for a long time, thinking. I try to remember things I've heard my parents talk about, and I decide to start there. I begin, \"When I was a kid, I was a lot more interested in my dad than I was my mom. I liked the stories that my dad used to tell, and I would listen to them while I was working on my homework or reading a book. My dad was a pretty good storyteller, and I loved hearing his voice. I thought I'd never get tired of listening to his voice.\nI recall one particular evening when my dad was telling a particularly interesting tale, and I was getting sleepy. I yawned and stretched my arms, and I said, \"Dad, I'm tired, I should go to bed now. Goodnight, Dad.\nI leaned forward and kissed his cheek, and I got up from the chair. I was halfway to my bedroom when my dad called out to me, \"Wait!\"\nI turned around, and my dad was standing in the doorway, smiling, \"You were really into the story tonight. I have a question for you, though. Do you think that I'm an amazing person, or a horrible person, based on the",
