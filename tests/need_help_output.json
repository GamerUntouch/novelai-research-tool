  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Stephanie Marie Kiser.\" I pause again, then continue, \"And I'm here because...\" My voice trails off, and I feel myself becoming flustered. What do I say? Why did I even come? This isn't something I should have done... I can hear Dr. Szozas thinking this too, his head nodding slightly in agreement.\nHe leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees, hands clasped together, waiting patiently for me to speak. After several moments, I begin again, \"and I'm here because I think I might be suffering from mental illness.\" The words tumble out of me, and they sound strange coming out of my mouth. I hadn't planned on saying any of this, but now that I've said it, I don't know if I want to stop talking.\nDr. Szozas looks up at me, and his face goes blank for a moment before he speaks, \"Can you tell me more?\"\nI nod, trying to get my thoughts back under control. How does one go about explaining what happened to them? I try to explain, starting with the first incident that had led to all of this, when I'd been attacked by the black dog outside my house. He listens intently, asking questions, prompting me with his own observations and suggestions. When I'm finished, he asks me if there's anything else that I would like to discuss.\nThe rest of the conversation is easy; we talk about my life, my family, where I live, things that I enjoy doing. It turns out that Dr. Szozas enjoys music, especially jazz -- that's his favorite genre. We end our meeting with him promising to schedule an appointment with me to review my file.\nI leave his office feeling much better than I did earlier. His smile was infectious, and his mannerisms were kind. As soon as I got home that night, I sent an email to Dr. Sz",

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Angela Davis.\" I pause again, waiting for more information, but nothing else comes forth. \"Why am I here?\"\nHe smiles gently, then leans forward in his chair, resting both elbows on his knees, \"Well, I think we should start by discussing what happened this morning.\"\nThis makes me feel better already, because he didn't ask any questions yet. I nod, and tell him, \"Yes, let's do that. What did happen this morning?\"\nDr. Szozas nods, and begins, \"You were sleeping soundly, when suddenly there was a tremendous crash, followed by screams...\" He pauses, and looks up at me, \"...and then silence. You came awake in bed, confused and disoriented. Your heart rate was elevated, blood pressure high, your breathing shallow. You felt lightheaded, and nauseous. How long have you been experiencing those symptoms?\"\nThat question is easy enough to answer: since yesterday afternoon when I started having them. \"Since last night. Since about 11pm.\"\nDr. Szozas notes all this down, making little circles in his notebook with a pen. He asks me to describe the events that occurred during the night, starting from the time I went to sleep until now. It feels strange talking about such personal things with another person; usually I would just go to therapy alone. But I trust Dr. Szozas completely, and I don't want to be rude, or to keep secrets. So I talk.\n\"Last night... I had dinner with friends, at a restaurant downtown. We talked, laughed, shared stories. Afterwards, they invited me back to their place, where we continued our conversation. At one point, after midnight, I got up to use the restroom, and I couldn't find it. I walked out into the hallway, and I saw that I wasn't in the right building. I looked up, and realized that I was outside",

The water just poured off me onto the floor. My husband was still at work, but we usually talk on the phone while I get ready for bed, so I knew he would have heard me arrive home soaking wet. But when I came downstairs, he wasn't there. He was supposed to pick up dinner for us both, but he never did. Instead, I found myself standing in our kitchen alone, and I didn't even realize it until later. When I tried to go back upstairs to change clothes, I realized that something was wrong; I couldn't move very well. I felt heavy, and sluggish, almost drunk. Everything seemed to be moving slowly, and when I tried to walk, I stumbled. That's when I noticed that my legs were trembling. And my arms too. They shook uncontrollably. I went into the bathroom to try to wash up, but when I looked at my reflection in the mirror, I saw that my face was covered in blood. My eyes, nose, mouth, ears, cheeks, forehead, everywhere. There was no way to clean it off. So I washed my hands, but they continued bleeding.\nAnd then I woke up. That's when I remembered that this was not real, that it had only been a dream. I told myself that it must be because I hadn't eaten enough that day, or maybe I needed more sleep.

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

But then I realize what this is all about, and my face turns redder as I continue, \"Amanda Brown.\" I pause again, wondering what else I should tell him. What would Dr. Szozas want to know?\nHe nods slowly, \"Yes, thank you, Amanda Brown, now please state your reason for coming today.\"\nOh crap, did I say that out loud? Oh god, I hope not! Am I being interrogated by a government agent? Should I get a lawyer? Wait, wait, hold on, let's think this through. First things first: I need to explain myself. I swallow hard, and start talking, trying to keep eye contact with him. It helps that he doesn't appear to be judging me or making fun of me. \"Well, um, I was reading online about a psychiatrist named Michael Szoszas...\"\nDr. Szozas holds up one finger, signaling me to stop speaking, and he asks, \"Do you have any other names?\"\n\"No, no others. I don't even really know where I heard his name before,\" I admit.\n\"And you were not referred to Dr. Szozas by another doctor?\"\n\"Uh, yes, actually, I found an article that said he was an expert at dealing with cases that are difficult to diagnose, such as mine. So, yeah, I came to see if he can help me figure out what's going on with me.\n\"OK, that sounds good. Now, we'll go ahead and begin, but first, I'd like to ask some questions. Please answer them truthfully, without embellishment, and do not worry about hurting my feelings; I promise that no matter what happens, no harm will come to you. Are",

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Olivia Rose.\"\nHe nods, \"And what brings you here today?\"\n\"Well...it's sort of hard to explain...\"\n\"Tell me all about it,\" he offers.\nSo I do. The story is long and complicated, and it took hours to tell. I feel better after telling it. I feel lighter, more relaxed. It helps to talk about it. And it feels good to get this off my chest.\nWhen I finish talking, Dr. Szozas sits quietly, thinking for quite a while before he speaks again. Finally, he looks up at me, and asks, \"Olivia, have you ever been sexually abused? Have you had any sexual experiences that were forced or coerced by another person?\"\nIt's one question too many, because I can't believe what he just asked me. I stare back at him blankly, wondering if I heard correctly. Is this really happening? Am I being accused of something terrible? My heart starts pounding, and I say nothing.\n\"Do you understand what I'm asking?\" he inquires, patiently waiting for an answer.\nOh God, please let me hear yes, please don't ask me anything else. Please don't accuse me of something I didn't do!\n\"Yes sir,\" I finally manage to squeak out.\n\"Have you ever experienced sex that was not consensual?\"\nI shake my head no. No way would I ever admit that to anyone. I've never done that! But I know that Dr. Szozas knows that.\n\"Are you sure about that?\" he asks, looking at me with those kind, concerned eyes.\nHow can he think that I did that?! I thought I was safe! I tried to be careful, I was always very cautious! I couldn't possibly have done that!\n\"You are absolutely sure that none of these things happened to you, correct?\"\nI nod my head no",

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Laura Parker.\" And then I pause again. What else should I tell him? My thoughts wander back to all the things that have been happening lately. It feels weird talking about this stuff to a stranger. But I know there's nothing wrong with being honest. I feel better after telling him.\nHe nods and asks, \"And what brings you here today?\"\nSo I start talking, sharing with him my story. As I do, I watch his face carefully; sometimes he looks away or turns his head, but mostly he listens intently, nodding occasionally, asking questions. When I finish, he stands up, and I can see that he wants to say something, but instead he just smiles, and shakes my hand firmly, saying, \"Laura, thank you very much for coming to see me. You've had quite an ordeal recently. I want to assure you that we will get through this together. In fact, if you'd like to stay longer, please let me know. I would really enjoy having more time to talk with you about your experiences.\" He pauses, and adds, \"But right now, I need to call a friend of mine. Please excuse me while I do that.\"\nAs soon as Dr. Szozas leaves the room, I jump up and run out into the hall. I slam open his office door, and I'm breathing hard, but I don't care. I'm so relieved that I didn't freak out. Dr. Szozas is such a nice guy. I hope that everything goes well with him!\nWhen Dr. Szozas returns, I am sitting in his chair. He sits back down, and says, \"You were great!\" His smile is warm and reassuring. Then he tells me that he's going to ask me some personal questions, but that they are not invasive or offensive. I nod, and agree.\nWe begin with a general discussion about my life, where I live,",

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

It had been a long day, and I was just going to go straight to bed. But I got into my pajamas, turned out the light, and sat down at my computer, intending to get some reading done. And when I did that, all of a sudden, I felt really weird. Like I wanted to jump up and dance around the room, but I couldn't move at all, and I didn't even realize that I'd gotten out of my chair until I heard my mother call out to me to come help her. I thought she was joking at first, but when I looked at my clock, I realized that it wasn't morning yet -- it was still dark outside, and I hadn't even gone to sleep.\n\"So anyway, I ran downstairs to wake her up, but by that time, she already knew that I was awake, because she could hear me moving about in my bedroom. She asked me if I needed anything, but I said that I was fine. I told her that I would be back to help with dinner, and I went to my bathroom to brush my teeth.

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Elizabeth Smith.\" My heart beats faster as I speak her name aloud, and I feel myself flush red, even though there is nothing sexual about this meeting.\nHe nods slowly, accepting my answer, then asks, \"And what brings you here today?\"\nI swallow hard, and begin again, \"Well... I have been experiencing severe headaches, nausea, dizziness, and extreme anxiety since last Friday night. The attacks came on suddenly after dinner, and they haven't stopped yet. I've tried taking aspirin, Tylenol, Advil, and Excedrin, but none seem to help.\" I pause, and take a deep breath before continuing, \"They are getting worse, too.\"\n\"Hmm, yes, I can certainly understand that...\" He pauses, then adds, \"Do you know if anything unusual happened prior to this onset? Did something happen recently that might trigger them?\"\n\"No, not really. Nothing specific, just lots of stress, maybe more than usual. I had some personal problems with my boyfriend two weeks ago, which led to an argument, but we worked through those issues together.\"\nDr. Szozas looks at me closely, \"Any other significant changes in your life recently?\"\n\"Not that I'm aware of, no. Why do you ask?\"\n\"Just trying to get a sense of what may be going on with you. Your symptoms are all very similar to migraines, but also somewhat different, and there are several possible explanations. Have any medical professionals looked at you?\"\nI shake my head no, \"no, no one has examined me or done tests or anything. It's only been me and the web searching.\"\n\"How long has this been going on?\"\n\"About three days now, but they started out mild, I was able to work around them most of the time. They got progressively worse until I couldn't function at all. I went to bed Thursday evening",

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Laura.\"\nHe nods, \"And why did you contact me?\"\nI swallow hard, and say, \"Well, uh...   My life isn't really all that exciting right now...\"\nHe smiles, \"It doesn't have to be. Just tell me what's going on.\"\nSo I start talking, telling him about my marriage, my job, my family, and then I get to my sexual problems. At this point, he interrupts me with a question: \"Do you think there may be something else happening? Something other than just your lack of interest in sex?\"\nI pause, thinking back to my past relationships. I've had three boyfriends, two of which were very good guys, one being quite abusive. I remember the night when I met David; we'd been friends since high school, and we dated off and on during college. He was sweet, gentle, thoughtful, caring, considerate, generous, attentive, passionate, loving -- but not sexually adventurous. We broke up after four years together, because he wasn't willing to try new things, or experiment, or go beyond kissing, petting, fondling, and oral sex.\nAfter I moved to San Diego, I began dating Jeff; he seemed nice enough, but nothing special. It didn't seem like he wanted to do anything more with me either, although he certainly tried to be romantic. When our relationship ended, I realized that I hadn't felt that way about any guy since David. I thought about Dr. Szozas' question, and I said, \"No, I don't think that's it. I feel fine. My husband is great, but I'm not interested in him anymore. I can't explain it, but it feels wrong to be intimate with him. I'm sure that if he knew about my problem, he would be understanding. But I don't want to hurt him by bringing it up, so I'm hoping",

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Christine.\" My hands start shaking slightly, and I try to hide this by crossing them in front of me. \"And... um...\" I pause again, trying to find the right words, \"...I don't know what's happening to me. It feels like something's wrong, but I can't tell if there really is anything wrong or not. I think maybe I need help. But I don't want to admit that to anyone else because then they'll just say 'you have depression,' or 'it's all in your head.' I've looked through the internet, but I haven't found any answers. I tried talking to people online, but I'm not sure if they were real doctors or not. The one person who seemed knowledgeable said that I should talk to someone, so I came here.\"\nDr. Szozas leans forward, placing his elbows on his knees, and he looks me straight in the eye while he listens intently. He nods his head once after I finish speaking, and then he sits back, taking off his glasses to rub his face before putting them back on. He studies me silently for several moments, and when his gaze finally breaks away from mine, he asks, \"Do you mind if we discuss what happened to you?\"\nI nod, and he continues, \"You mentioned that you went to an office building, where you spoke to another doctor, but she didn't seem very helpful to you. Did you feel that way, or did she give you an impression that was different than that? You also mentioned that you talked to some other people, but that you weren't sure whether they had medical degrees. Is that correct?\"\nI shrug, \"Yeah, I guess. They were pretty vague about their qualifications, but I got the sense that they knew more about psychology than medicine. Some of them told me that it was fine to call them 'doctor' even though they didn't have MDs. I thought that was",

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Amanda Smith.\" And then pause again, wondering if this isn't a good idea, \"And...?\"\nHe smiles, \"Well, Amanda, we'll start with what brought you here today.\"\nI nod nervously, \"It started yesterday. I woke up feeling really sick. My stomach felt awful, and I couldn't eat anything. I tried to go back to sleep, but I just kept thinking about being sick, and I thought maybe I should call 911, but I didn't want them to think I was crazy or something...\"\nDr. Szozas nods sympathetically, \"Yes, that sounds familiar, especially after what happened to you last week. We'll get there eventually, but let's talk about the present first.\"\n\"OK,\" I say tentatively, unsure where this is going.\nDr. Szozas pauses briefly, \"Amanda, do you remember when you were young, playing games with other children? Do you recall ever having those dreams or nightmares about monsters or demons attacking you, causing you harm?\"\nOh crap, now I know what this is all about. He wants to put together a report, and he needs me to describe these things, but I don't even know if they are real or not. What would a psychiatrist write up in his records? Maybe it will help me figure out what's happening with me. But I have to tell him the truth.\n\"No, I can't actually remember any of that. It was probably just kids' stuff. The kind that makes everyone laugh when they hear about it later.\"\n\"You may be right, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it wasn't true. Let me ask you another question: Have you ever had trouble sleeping at night, but you wake up at 3am screaming because of bad dreams?\"\n\"Um, yes, but that was years ago, before I got married. Why are you asking me all of these questions,",

He asks questions about how long the headaches last, if they are accompanied by nausea, what kinds of dreams I've been having, whether or not I'm afraid of getting hit anymore, does anyone else know about the pregnancy? Does anybody know that I am taking those drugs? Is my mother aware? Are any friends? What are my plans after the baby is born?\nWhen I finish telling him everything, he sits quietly for a moment, contemplating his hands clasped together. Then he looks up at me, and smiles kindly at me, \"Lisa, you are clearly very confused. You are feeling lost and alone, and scared. I think we should talk more specifically about what is happening with you.

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Karen.\"\nHe nods, and then asks, \"And what brings you here today?\"\nAgain I hesitate, wondering where this will go, but I continue, \"Well, uh...it all started after I watched one of those true crime shows...\"\n\"Ah yes, they can do terrible things to people's minds. They'll have their subjects watch violent videos, or listen to loud noises, and other such stimuli, and ask them to describe what happened afterwards. The results vary widely, but often times the subject describes events that never actually occurred. It's called 'confabulation', or false memory syndrome.\" He looks at me intently, waiting for me to elaborate.\n\"Yeah, well, that's exactly what happened to me,\" I say slowly, trying to explain myself.\n\"OK, now let's start again. What was your name before you were hypnotized? And why did you come to our office?\" He prompts.\n\"Karen,\" I answer, and try not to think about how strange it feels to be talking to this man about my past life.\n\"Good, good. Now tell me, Karen, when you woke up last Friday morning, did anything seem different than usual?\" His voice is calm, but his eyes are intense.\nI pause, considering his question. \"No, nothing seemed different, except that I had an appointment with Dr. Szozas at 9am on Monday.\"\n\"Hmmm. OK, well, we'll get to that in just a minute. First, I'd like to know more about you, Karen. Tell me something about yourself -- where are you from, what are your hobbies, any siblings, parents, pets, etcetera.\"\nIt is amazing that I am able to talk at length about myself, but I find that I am enjoying telling Dr. Szozas about me. I'm surprised by his questions; most therapists I've seen are so",

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Stephanie Bennett.\"\nHe nods thoughtfully, then asks, \"Can you tell me what brought you here today?\"\nOh boy... this isn't easy, but I try to explain, \"Well, I've been having dreams lately, vivid ones, where people are hurting me, or trying to hurt me, and they're all wearing masks, and I don't know who any of them are...\"\nDr. Szazas listens intently, nodding slowly as I continue, \"And I have trouble sleeping now, because whenever I do sleep, I dream those same things again, even though I wake up feeling refreshed, without any physical pain or bruises, just memories of what happened while I was asleep.\"\nDr. Szazas sits back, hands clasped together in front of him, head cocked slightly, \"So, you think that there's something wrong with you? You feel different than other girls your age?\"\nI nod, \"Yes, I guess I do. I can't seem to concentrate properly anymore. It feels like everyone wants to control me somehow, but I'm not sure if I want to be controlled by anyone else. And I get angry easily, sometimes, when nobody will listen to me, but most of the time I don't understand why I feel that way. Sometimes I wonder if I should be afraid of myself, but I'm scared to admit that to anybody.\"\nDr. Szozas smiles, and looks at me kindly, \"You are a very brave girl to come to me with such concerns. I would never ask you to trust me, but I hope that we can help each other.\"\nI look up at him with wide, fearful eyes, and say, \"How can I be sure that you'll be able to help me, Doctor? What are my options? I don't really know anything about being a woman, let alone a teenager!\"\nHe leans forward, his face serious, \"Step",
