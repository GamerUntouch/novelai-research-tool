He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",

It began when I got a job offer at a very prestigious company in New York City. The pay was great, but the work wasn't exactly what I expected. It seemed more administrative than anything else, and there were many meetings where I had to attend. But then one day I went to a meeting, and something happened during the presentation. A woman stood up and asked if anyone had any questions. Well, I raised my hand, and she said, \"You can ask us anything\". I was confused because I didn't know her. She continued, \"Anything at all\", and the room erupted in laughter. That made me uncomfortable, and I left the room early.\nThat night I couldn't sleep. I tossed and turned for hours, thinking about the woman I met at the meeting. I tried to recall the details of our conversation, and I remembered that we talked for a long time. I kept trying to remember the names and faces of everyone in the room. I even looked at the picture boards, and I saw the woman I thought I knew. I felt a sense of unease and fear.\nThe next morning I woke up, and I realized that I hadn't slept a wink. I also recalled that I'd been talking to the woman for a long time, and I wondered what I would say to her. I took a shower, and I decided I needed to go to the bathroom. I walked into the hallway, and there was the woman. We made eye contact and smiled at each other. I froze, and I just stared at her, unable to move. I think I said, \"Hi, I'm Jane...\"\nShe interrupted me, \"I'm sorry, I don't recognize you. Please tell me your name again.\"\n",

  "prompt": "I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",
  "result": "My name is Rebecca.\"\n\"OK, good, now tell me about yourself, Rebecca. Why did you choose this particular therapist?\"\nI pause again, unsure what to say, but then I realize that I have been thinking too much, and I just start talking. I explain, \"Well, I've never had any trouble sleeping before, until recently. It started last year, when I was getting married. My husband is very busy, and working long hours, and I was really stressed out by the time we got home from our wedding rehearsal dinner. And I would wake up at night, and I couldn't get back to sleep...and I'd toss and turn all night, even though I didn't want to get up. \nSo one morning I decided that I wasn't happy anymore, and I asked my parents if they knew anyone that I could talk to. They suggested a counselor, and I went online and found a few names. I chose yours because I liked the sound of your voice when I listened to the audio files. I thought you sounded smart and professional, and I wanted to work with someone that sounded smart, and I think I found the perfect person for the job.\nThen I explained my situation, and I realized that I needed help. I need to figure out what the heck is wrong with me, and I need to know if there is something I can do about my insomnia. I don't understand myself at all, and I need some help.\nI feel nervous, and I hope I haven't embarrassed myself. I'm not sure if I should go on or not.\nDr. Szozas listens to my story carefully, and he nods, \"I'll be honest, Rebecca, I'm a little surprised. I expected to hear a more complicated case, perhaps a marriage gone bad, an affair, a child custody battle, some other kind of conflict. But you are a woman in her mid-twenties, and",
