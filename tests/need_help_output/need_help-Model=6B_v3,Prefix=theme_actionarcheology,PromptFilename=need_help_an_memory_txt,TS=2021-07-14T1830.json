He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",

I don't know what to say.\nHe smiles, and nods knowingly, and then asks, \"What brings you to our clinic today?\"\nI stammer, \"Um...  ...uhh...\" I can't think of anything. I'm nervous, but I have to get something off my chest. I clear my throat, and speak again, \"I uhm...have a problem that needs help. And I was wondering if you would be able to give me advice about it. Please tell me all about yourself and how you came to specialize in unusual cases.\"\nDr. Szozas sits back, and folds his hands in his lap. \"You are a very open-minded young lady. You will find that I am an expert in the field of unusual cases. I believe that I may be the only counselor in the country who specializes in such cases. I'm a psychiatrist, and a licensed clinical psychologist. I have a master's degree in psychology, a bachelor's in chemistry, and a doctorate in psychiatry. I also hold an advanced certificate in hypnosis, and I work closely with the police department on cases involving hypnotically-induced crimes. I teach classes on the use of hypnosis in criminal investigations, and I conduct seminars for the FBI on the subject.\nI want to ask him how old he is, but I refrain from asking because I realize that I probably shouldn't be inquiring about his age. I'm a little embarrassed by my question, and I blush slightly as I look away.\nDr. Szozas continues, \"I am a psychiatrist and counselor for the Los Angeles Police Department,",

  "prompt": "I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",
  "result": "My name is Lara Jane Drake.\"\nHe nods, and then looks back at me. The silence stretches uncomfortably long between us. What should I say? How do I begin this conversation?   I've never had a therapist before, and I don't know what to expect. But I can tell by the expression on his face that something is wrong, and I feel myself becoming more anxious. It's not just the fact that we have nothing to talk about, but also because I want to help him, whatever his problem may be.\nFinally, he breaks the silence, \"Lara, would you mind telling me a little bit about yourself?\"\nI start to answer, and I realize that I haven't thought about my life since I woke up in the cave. Well, I guess I did think about my past a lot; I spent a good deal of time thinking about all the things that happened to me in my previous lives, and I wondered if I was supposed to be doing any of those things. I wonder if I was meant to meet up with my mother, or if she was merely a figment of my imagination. I ask myself, \"Why am I alive, and where am I now?\"\nI'm not sure if I should tell the truth, or if I'm even allowed to tell the truth. I decide to err on the side of caution, \"I was born in the United States in New York City, in Manhattan; I was raised in Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island; and I attended college at Columbia University for two years in the city. I went to medical school at NYU, and graduated in the top ten percent of my class. I interned at Mount Sinai Hospital for a year, and I worked there for a while.
