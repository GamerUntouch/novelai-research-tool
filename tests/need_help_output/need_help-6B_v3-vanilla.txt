=== Prompt ========================================
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "

=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Samantha Jane Williams." My parents named me after their favorite singer (Samantha Jones) because they thought it would be cute. It wasn't until college that I learned her real last name was Smith, which makes me wonder if they knew something then. I continue, "As for why I'm here... well, this isn't exactly where I expected to find myself..." I trail off, unsure what else to say.
He smiles reassuringly, and continues, "That's understandable. Why don't we start by talking about you? What do you do?"
Oh boy, now I'm really nervous. This guy is a shrink! A doctor! How can he possibly understand what I'm going through? The answer dawns on me: He already knows. He just wants to hear me talk about it. "Well, uhm, I work at an accounting firm. I started there right out of school, and I've been working there ever since."
"What brought you to that profession? Did you always want to be an accountant?"
"Yes sir. Ever since high school I wanted to be a CPA, but I never got accepted into any schools. I worked part time at several different jobs while trying to save up enough money to go back to school. When I finally graduated with my degree in Accounting, I was offered a job at the same place I had interned at. And I haven't looked back since."
He nods his head, taking notes about my story. "Why did you choose to become an Accountant?"
"It was a great career choice for me, at least at first. I was good at math, and I loved numbers. I also liked that I didn't have to deal with people all day long. I could focus solely on my work without having to worry about annoying customers or coworkers who were constantly bothering me. Plus, the pay was very lucrative."
"So how does that apply to

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Christine Smith."
He nods, then asks, "And why do you think this is happening?"
I pause again, unsure what to say next. How can I explain? What would happen if I tell him what's really going on? Would he laugh at me, or worse yet, call 911? Or maybe...maybe he'd believe me, and help me figure things out? But will he even listen? Maybe he'll just want to get rid of me.
"Um..." I begin tentatively, "Well, there have been times when I've felt different than usual. Like other people aren't seeing me or hearing me, or feeling what I feel. And I don't know if that's normal." My face flushes red as I realize how much more difficult this explanation is becoming. The doctor doesn't seem fazed by anything. He watches me intently, waiting patiently.
After another moment, he speaks gently, "Tell me about those feelings."
So I start talking about being invisible, or having my voice muted when I speak. About not being able to touch anyone else except for my boyfriend, who is also invisible to everyone else. About feeling alone, and disconnected from everyone.
Dr. Szozas listens quietly throughout my description. When I finish, he sits back in his chair, thinking. His hands are clasped together loosely, his elbows resting atop them. His expression remains neutral, but his eyes continue to study me.
Finally, he looks up at me, "Christine, did you ever consider that perhaps you were adopted?"
My mouth drops open; I stare at him, stunned. This is crazy talk!
"Didn't occur to me either, but that was something that we considered, yes," he responds calmly, almost soothingly. His tone is gentle, but firm.
"What does that mean?"
"It means that you may be experiencing an unusual form of adoption,

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Jane Smith." And then I continue, "And yes, this is a very unusual case. My life has been turned upside down by some sort of... something..." I pause again, searching for words, "...that I can't quite put my finger on, and I don't know what to do next."
He nods slowly, encouragingly, "That's understandable. Please go ahead and tell me more about your situation."
So I start talking: "I have two children, one boy, one girl, both teenagers now. They live at home with their mother. I've never divorced them. When they were younger, we would fight all the time, which got worse after my husband passed away four years ago. Things have gotten better recently, but there's still tension between us. We don't really talk much anymore, because we disagree too often. But things are getting better, and maybe soon we'll become friends again. That's good news. The other day, though, when I was taking out the garbage, I overheard our daughter telling her friend that she wished her mom had died instead of dad. It shocked me, but it didn't surprise me either. She's always said that. Now I'm worried about her mental health, but I can't imagine doing anything about it. What should I do?"
Dr. Szozas listens intently to me, nodding occasionally, asking questions only to clarify points that are unclear. He asks me to describe my relationship with my ex-husband, how long did you last? How many times have you tried to reconcile with him since his death? Did you try counseling together before coming to me? I answer each question, and he writes notes in his notepad while I speak. He also makes some phone calls, checking to see if any progress has been made.
After an hour or so, Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair, and looks at me thoughtfully, "Jane

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Zoey." My hands rest on top of them, palms upwards, waiting for further instruction.
He nods, then asks, "Zoey... what do you remember?"
I pause again, thinking back, trying to recall details of the last few days. It feels like there were lots of events that happened all at once. A lot of things happen to people every day, so they don't really stand out. But this one event seemed different somehow. The world changed, maybe? Or was it just me?
I shrug, and say, "Well, yesterday morning, after getting home from work, my wife came into our bedroom, and she said something odd..."
He cuts me off, saying, "Go ahead."
"... She asked if we had sex yet today, and when I answered 'no', she got mad at me. And she left the room. That was about 8:30am. At 10:00am, I went to the bathroom, and noticed that I'd wet myself. When I looked under the toilet lid, I saw blood coming out of my penis. I tried to stop it, but couldn't get any control over it. So I called 911, and by the time they arrived, I was bleeding pretty heavily. They took me to the hospital, where they did surgery to try to stem the flow of blood. After that, I slept until about 4pm. Around 5:30pm, I woke up feeling very sick to my stomach. So I vomited, and then passed out. This afternoon, I woke up, but felt terrible. I've been nauseous ever since. So I think I may have a ruptured appendix or an ulcerated colon. My doctor is supposed to be seeing me tomorrow at noon. Do you know what's wrong with me, Dr. Szozas?"
He smiles, and shakes his head.
"No idea, but I can tell that you

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Sarah, and...well..." My mind races, trying to find something else to say. It feels weird talking about myself to this stranger.
He laughs gently, "It's ok, just relax."
So I do. And we wait there together for a while.
Eventually, he breaks the silence by asking me questions, "Do you have any other family besides mom?"
This question surprises me, because I had been thinking more along the lines of 'what happened between us?' But I don't know what to tell him, so I remain silent. He looks disappointed, then continues, "And where did you go today? Did you stay home all day long?"
Again, I feel uncomfortable responding, but I try to answer honestly, "No, actually I went shopping."
"Shopping? What were you buying?"
I start to think back, remembering what I bought yesterday. The list begins to form in my head:
1) A new bra (with padding),
2) Some underwear (to match the bra, and with lace trimming).
3) Two pairs of stockings (one sheer black pair, one white pair, both thigh high).
4) Some pantyhose (lace trimmed ones, too).
5) Panties (black with ruffled edges).
6) Bra (white with pink ribbons).
7) Top (pink with spaghetti straps).
8) Dress (red with sequins, strapless neckline).
9) Shoes (heels with red soles).
10) Earrings.
11) Necklaces.
12) Bracelets.
13) Hair accessories.
14) Makeup.
15) Lipstick.
16) Perfume.
17) Other stuff.
18) Gift cards.
19) Gifts.
20) Homework.
21) Dinner at the restaurant.
22)

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Mary Jane Watson." The words slip off my tongue easily enough, and I feel them roll off my lips. It feels good to say those names aloud after all this time. "And I need help, because something is wrong with me..." My mind wanders, and then I realize what I've just said. I try again, "...something strange is happening inside me...and I don't know if I can handle it anymore."
He leans forward slightly, and asks quietly, "What do you think is 'wrong'?"
"Well...my body isn't mine," I begin slowly. "It doesn't belong to me, and it does things without asking permission. Like when I get hungry, or thirsty, I want to eat or drink something -- anything -- and my body will go out and buy whatever I ask for. And sometimes it buys stuff that makes me sick. But other times it goes shopping and brings back healthy food. That's how bad I have been feeling lately. I thought maybe there was an infection going around, but I didn't catch any illness. Maybe I caught something else? I'm not sure what's happening to me."
Dr. Szozas nods, and continues to listen attentively. He looks concerned, but also intrigued.
I continue: "When I woke up today, I felt better than ever before. I haven't had headaches since last week. I haven't even wanted to sleep much. This morning, I got up early, and I went to work. I did laundry, cooked breakfast, cleaned up. Everything seemed normal -- until about 2pm. Then I started getting tired, really tired, and it wasn't from working too hard. It was like I couldn't keep myself awake. So I called in sick, and took a nap."
Dr. Szozas is quiet, his expression one of deep interest.
"Afterwards, I tried to figure out what happened, but I

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Alexei Vasiliev." I pause there, feeling awkward. This isn't something I've done before, this whole 'sitting in front of another person', talking about myself. It's not easy for me. But then again, it doesn't seem hard for Dr. Szozas either. He just looks back at me expectantly, waiting patiently for me to continue.
So I do, "Alexei, um... I guess I should tell you what happened..." I say hesitantly, "...and I'll try not to get too personal, but..." I feel uncomfortable all of a sudden, embarrassed by what I'm saying. What if he thinks I'm crazy?
He smiles at me reassuringly, "Go ahead Alexei, don't worry about getting personal. We can always stop any time you want." He sounds sincere, and his smile tells me that we are both okay with whatever happens next.
"Well, last week was my birthday, and I had a really good day. I went out with friends to dinner, and they took me out dancing afterwards. Afterwards, I met up with them at their apartment, where we were going to go hang out, watch movies or play games or something. Well, when I got there, they weren't home yet. So I decided to wait for them downstairs, thinking that maybe they'd come back soon. And I'm not sure how long I waited, but I must have been sitting there for hours. I think it was almost midnight when I heard voices coming from upstairs, so I figured that must be who they were.
"When I came up, I found that one of the guys, James, was lying face-down on his bed, naked. The other guy, Mike, was sitting on his lap, facing him, while he had his pants off, his cock out, and he was jerking himself off. They looked at me with these weird expressions,

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Kaitlyn, and I... um..."
He cuts me off, smiling again, "Just relax. Tell me what brings you here."
So I start talking. I tell him all about my family situation, and how I have been feeling lately, especially since this morning. How I had trouble sleeping last night because I couldn't stop thinking about my brother, my mother's boyfriends, and even the men from work. I didn't feel like myself today, and I felt angry and jealous whenever anyone looked at her. It was hard to concentrate, and I just wanted to leave the house.
When I finish telling him about my day, I find myself wanting to cry, but I don't want to ruin our meeting by crying in front of him. Instead, I try to think about something else, anything else, but nothing comes to mind. Finally, after what feels like an eternity, Dr. Szozas speaks. He tells me that I seem very tense, which makes sense considering that I haven't slept well in days. And then he asks me if there is any way to help me sleep better tonight.
It was such a simple question, yet I can't answer him right away. My thoughts race through my head, trying to figure out how he would know that I wasn't sleeping well, or how to go about fixing it. What does he do? Does he give me pills to put me to sleep? Is he going to hypnotize me or use some other method to calm me down? Oh god, I hope not! I've heard too many horror stories about hypnosis and the things that people say when they are under its influence.
Finally, I decide that I should ask Dr. Szozas about his methods, so I blurt, "Dr. Szozas, may I please ask you about your methods?"
"Of course!" he answers, and his smile widens. His teeth are white,

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Rachel. I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia by two different psychiatrists."
He nods slowly, and leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees. "Do you believe that?" he asks gently.
"No... yes..." I answer tentatively. "It doesn't matter what I think. It's just a label they gave me. What do you want to know?"
"Well, let's start with where you live, then we'll get to who else might be involved, ok? Do you own any real estate?"
"Yes, a house in the suburbs. Why does this matter?"
"Because you may need to sell it."
I blink several times, and wait for him to continue. He watches me closely, waiting for me to reply.
Finally, I say, "What makes you think that?"
He shrugs, "You don't seem like an intelligent woman, Ms. Rachel. You don't appear to be capable of managing anything other than basic needs. And you seem very isolated. But you've managed to hold onto your home despite being unable to maintain even the most basic living conditions there. That tells me that either you are extremely wealthy or that you have significant resources available to help you deal with whatever issues you face. The latter would be far more likely, given that you are not currently employed, and that you are not receiving public assistance. If that is indeed the case, you should consider selling that property and investing the proceeds in something that will provide financial security, such as a CD account. Your income tax return shows that you earn $20K per year. A CD can yield 5% interest compounded annually, which is almost twice that rate. Investing $50K now can result in a minimum of $10,000 a month -- enough to pay all of your expenses, including rent, utilities, food, clothing, medical care, etc., without having to worry about money ever again. This amount can

My name is Mary Jane Watson."
He nods, "And why are you here?"
"Well...it started off small..." I begin.
He smiles encouragingly, "Tell me more."
So I tell him all about what happened last night after dinner. When I get to where I went home alone, he asks, "Did anything happen there? Did you have any dreams or fantasies about anyone?"
I blush slightly, remembering my dream about Mr. Grey. My face heats up, but then I remember Dr. Szozas smiling at me, and I feel better. It's not something I want to talk about. I shake my head, "No, nothing really happened."
Dr. Szozas continues to smile kindly at me, and I can't help feeling good about myself when he does. He tells me to continue, and I do.
After I finish talking, Dr. Szozas looks at me thoughtfully for several minutes before asking, "What did you learn from this experience?"
"That I should probably avoid going home by myself," I answer honestly.
He nods slowly, "Yes, yes indeed. You need to be careful, especially if you've been acting differently than normal lately. Your behavior may seem odd or strange to others, but that doesn't necessarily mean that what you are experiencing is abnormal. What would be considered normal for one person might not be for another. For example, how many people have had sexual experiences with their mother?"
I think back to the way that Mrs. Johnson acted at our Halloween party, and I realize that she was definitely not being herself; her voice was higher pitched, her words were slower and softer. She seemed to be speaking to me, but also to everyone else. Her eyes, too, seemed to be focused elsewhere.
"I'm not sure. I don't know. But I'd say that most people haven't done that, at least not that I
