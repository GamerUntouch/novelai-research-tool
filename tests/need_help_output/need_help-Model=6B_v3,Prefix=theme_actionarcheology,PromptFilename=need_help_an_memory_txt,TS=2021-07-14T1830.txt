=== Prompt ========================================
I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
[Period: Modern Day]
[Year: 2020 AD]
[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "


=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is   . I live in San Diego, California." My voice sounds strained and weak. I've never been good at making conversation. It just doesn't seem natural to talk to people. I usually feel awkward talking to strangers, and this guy looks so much more attractive than any other person that I've ever met. I don't know what to say.
He smiles, and nods knowingly, and then asks, "What brings you to our clinic today?"
I stammer, "Um...  ...uhh..." I can't think of anything. I'm nervous, but I have to get something off my chest. I clear my throat, and speak again, "I uhm...have a problem that needs help. And I was wondering if you would be able to give me advice about it. Please tell me all about yourself and how you came to specialize in unusual cases."
Dr. Szozas sits back, and folds his hands in his lap. "You are a very open-minded young lady. You will find that I am an expert in the field of unusual cases. I believe that I may be the only counselor in the country who specializes in such cases. I'm a psychiatrist, and a licensed clinical psychologist. I have a master's degree in psychology, a bachelor's in chemistry, and a doctorate in psychiatry. I also hold an advanced certificate in hypnosis, and I work closely with the police department on cases involving hypnotically-induced crimes. I teach classes on the use of hypnosis in criminal investigations, and I conduct seminars for the FBI on the subject.
I want to ask him how old he is, but I refrain from asking because I realize that I probably shouldn't be inquiring about his age. I'm a little embarrassed by my question, and I blush slightly as I look away.
Dr. Szozas continues, "I am a psychiatrist and counselor for the Los Angeles Police Department,

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Lara Drake. I live in San Francisco."
He nods slowly, then asks, "And why are you here?"
I reply, "Because I have this problem, and I don't know what to do about it."
"What sort of problem would that be? Please explain," he prompts, and I tell him, "Well, I've been having trouble sleeping lately. It started after my divorce last year. The whole situation just got to be too much, and I couldn't sleep anymore. And now that the new year is starting, it feels even worse than before. My mind races through all sorts of scenarios. I keep thinking about my ex-husband and our marriage, and whether we'll ever get back together again... I think about what will happen if we try to reconcile, and I feel sick to my stomach. I want to talk to somebody, but I can't seem to stop myself. I'm afraid to go to bed at night because I fear I won't wake up in the morning. I'm terrified I might not wake up at all, and I'd never hear the alarm clock in the morning..."
Dr. Szozas sits quietly, listening intently to my tale. He looks at me, and he smiles, and I smile back at him, and I continue to speak, "I guess I'm not making any sense at all. I'm sorry. I'm not used to talking to people, especially men, and I don't usually open up to strangers. But I really need help, and I hope you can give me some advice. I know I sound crazy, but I'm sure you understand. I'm not a nutcase or anything, I promise. I'm a pretty normal person, I just have a lot on my plate right now. Can I ask you some questions to see where I stand, and maybe I can come to grips with my problems? I'm asking for your professional opinion. 

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Lara Jane Drake."
He nods, and then responds, "And what brings you to our little clinic?"
"Well..." I begin, but I can tell by the way he looks at me that this is not the time to go off topic. I continue, "I have been experiencing strange feelings about myself lately, and I don't know what to do about them."
Szozas smiles, and continues, "That sounds very interesting. Let's start at the beginning, shall we? You say that you've been feeling different lately. Tell me more."
So I tell him all about it, starting with the dream I had last night, and continuing on through today.
When I finish, he just sits there for a moment, and thinks deeply before speaking again, "Do you recall the dreams that you experienced last night, or did they fade away too fast for you to remember them clearly?"
I think for a second, and I reply, "No, I actually remembered most of the details, but I was a bit surprised to find out that I was dreaming. I thought I was awake, but I guess I wasn't."
"I'd say that was a good sign, and I'll bet you felt pretty relieved to realize that the dream was only a dream. That means you were able to distinguish the difference between reality and fantasy, which is a big step in recovery. It also shows a lot of courage on your part to share something personal with me, especially when you're not sure if I will understand or believe you. I appreciate that."
I smile, and thank him for his words, and his understanding.
Dr. Szozas asks, "What happened to you after the dream ended?"
I describe everything from when I woke up, to when I arrived at the coffee shop.
After I finished my story, Dr. Szozas continued, "Did you feel any changes in the atmosphere of

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Lara Drake." 
I pause, then continue, "And I've been having problems sleeping, and I can't seem to get enough sleep. It's hard for me to concentrate.  I feel tired all the time, and sometimes I don't want to do anything. And I have trouble getting motivated..."
He looks at me thoughtfully, and asks, "Have you ever had any issues with alcohol?"
I shake my head, "No, never drank before, though I've heard that drinking helps people relax, and help them sleep better. But I haven't tried it yet... What about drugs? Do they help you sleep?"
Dr. Szozas smiles, "Not at all. Drugs will not cure insomnia, but if one is suffering from severe anxiety, or depression, or other psychological conditions, and the use of medication may provide a solution to their problem. However, when using medications to treat a condition, there is always a chance of side effects. If the patient is also experiencing a physiological issue, such as anemia or a thyroid disorder, the use of prescription or non-prescription drugs is usually contraindicated. There is a strong possibility of addiction, which would result in withdrawal symptoms, and the potential for serious medical complications, including death.
"What is the nature of your insomnia, Ms. Drake?"
I tell him, "It's a very difficult to describe. I just wake up in the middle of the night, and I'm wide awake. I'm restless, and I'm tense, and I'm anxious. I can't calm myself down. I try to go back to bed, but I keep thinking about things, and I start worrying about stuff. I think I'm going crazy!"
I sigh, and add, "I'm afraid to go to sleep. Sometimes I stay up all night, because I'm too nervous to fall asleep. Then when the alarm goes off in the morning

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Lara Drake, and I have been having trouble sleeping lately." I tell him.
He nods, then asks, "Have you ever had any sleep problems before?"
I shake my head, "No...not really. I've just never been able to get very good rest at night. My mind races all day long, and I find myself unable to concentrate during the daytime."
"Tell me about this issue you mentioned earlier."  He instructs me.
So I do. I describe what I think is happening, how my dreams seem more real than reality, and how they become confusing and disjointed. How I feel disconnected from my body, and how I can't remember things clearly after waking up in the morning. I try to explain that sometimes I forget where I put something, or I leave my keys at home, or I don't know which way is north.
Dr. Szozas listens patiently, nodding occasionally, asking a few questions now and again. When I finish, he leans back in his chair, and exhales a deep breath.
I wait for his response.
Finally, "Lara, I believe I may be able to help you. Let's begin by doing a little homework together; I want to ask you a series of questions that will allow us to determine if I should recommend a referral for further treatment."
I'm a bit nervous, but I nod my assent.
He stands up, and starts walking around his office. He opens a door, and I follow. Inside is a small office with a desk, two chairs, a filing cabinet, and a computer. He sits at the desk, and turns on the computer.
I stand in the doorway, watching.
Dr. Szozas types a couple of commands, and a window pops up on the screen.
It looks like an old DOS prompt.
I watch as he enters a command, and the screen changes to

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Lara Croft, and I'm seeing Dr. Michael Szozas because I have been feeling... off."   I pause again, wondering if this is too much information, but then I continue, "I've had trouble sleeping lately, and I feel restless. It started after I moved back home. My dad passed away recently, and I haven't felt right since. I keep thinking about things, and sometimes I get very anxious. I also find myself wanting to do things, even though I know they aren't good for me. I just can't seem to stop doing them. It's like there is something inside of me that wants to act out, and I don't understand what the trigger is. Sometimes I wonder if it is the stress of moving back home and being reminded of my father. I miss him terribly. Other times I think maybe I want to go out and explore the world, meet new people, experience different cultures. I need help understanding my feelings. I need to figure out a way to control my impulses. I need to learn to channel my energy and focus on the important stuff. I need to work on my self-control. I need to accept my limitations and not try to force myself to be a super hero. I need to accept my life, and not always live in the past. I need to forgive my parents, and move on. I'm afraid I will never be happy unless I do all those things. I'm scared, and I need to talk to someone. I guess I'm looking for a therapist to help me sort out my problems. 
Dr. Szozas listens attentively, and nods, and looks at me for a long moment before he speaks. "I'm sorry for the delay in getting to you; I was out running an errand. I'll try not to waste any more time on small talk, I'm sure we both have better uses for our time. You said you are

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Lara Croft. My friends call me Lari." 
He nods slowly, saying nothing, waiting for more information. I continue, "I'm twenty years old, and I live alone.   I have no family, and I've never been married. I work at the university library where I do research on ancient cultures. I go to school part time, and I just finished my junior year. I don't know what else to tell you. What can I help you with?"
Dr. Szozas leans back in his chair, hands clasped loosely between his knees, thinking for a moment. He looks at me again, and then asks, "Have you ever had a dream about something or somebody, but when you wake up, the memory is gone? Or maybe a daydream, and when you try and remember the details, they are vague and hazy?"
I nod, "Yes, many times."
"So when did this start happening to you?"
I answer, "Well, I guess I noticed it when I was in my early teens. I'd be having a good night's sleep, and suddenly I would awaken, and I couldn't recall anything that happened during my dreams. It was frustrating. I'd think I remembered something important, only to realize that I didn't. I even tried to write things down, but I was unable to. I thought that I might be losing my mind, and I was scared. I started seeing a psychologist, and we worked on various techniques to deal with the problem. We were unsuccessful. The problem persisted.
I decided to consult a psychiatrist, and I found a very nice man named Dr. Szozas. He recommended a cognitive behavioral therapy program, which I followed religiously. I went through the exercises and learned to cope with the loss of my memories in my dreams. I was able to get a handle on my fears, and the nightmares subsided. I haven

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Lara Jane Drake, and I'm here because I need help."
He smiles again, and nods his head, "Go ahead, tell me about it."
So I do. And I don't hold anything back. It feels good to talk about this stuff, even though I know that I'll probably regret telling him everything. But I need help.
And then I realize, I've been talking for almost half an hour, and I haven't asked him any questions. 
Dr. Szozas listens intently, and he asks a few clarifying questions when needed. He also makes notes on his tablet computer.
After I finish, I wait for a while before responding, "Well? What did you think?"
"I thought you were very brave and honest, and I can certainly relate to what you are feeling. I have a couple of things to say, and I'd appreciate if you would hear me out. First, I want to congratulate you for having the courage to come in and share what is obviously a difficult experience. Second, I want to reassure you that whatever is bothering you is not unusual or abnormal. In fact, I am sure there is a great deal that is normal in what is happening. Third, I believe that we will get to the bottom of what is troubling you, and I hope that I can help. Now, I'm going to ask that you answer a question for the record, and I'll explain the purpose of the exercise.
Lara, I want you to describe in words what you are experiencing in the present moment. Tell me, please, exactly where you are, and what is going on right now."
I close my eyes, and I visualize the room I'm in, and I imagine myself sitting on the couch. I open my eyes, and I look at Dr. Szozas.
"I'm in a doctor's office, and I just finished sharing my problem with

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Lara Drake, and I've been having problems sleeping."
He nods, "And why do you think this is happening?"
I pause again, and then state, "Well...it started after my divorce last year. My ex-husband was a jerk, and we were married for seven years before he cheated on me. It took us three months to find out about the affair, but I had already found out that he was cheating several weeks earlier. I knew something was wrong, because he wasn't acting right. I confronted him, and he denied the whole thing, and he said that if he did cheat on me, it would never happen again. And I believed him."
Dr. Szozas asks, "How long ago was this incident? Can you recall exactly what happened?"
I answer, "It was just a couple of days before Christmas, I remember that much. We went out for dinner, and we'd gone to bed early, and I woke up in the morning to a note saying 'I'll call you later.' I thought nothing of it, and I didn't hear from him for a week, and when I finally called, I got the runaround. He hung up on me, and I realized that I needed to get a restraining order against my husband to keep him away from me. I filed the papers the next day, and I haven't heard from my husband since the divorce became final."
I stop talking, and I feel myself starting to tear up, and I can't help the sniffling. I try to compose myself, and I say, "I'm sorry, I don't know what else to tell you. I'm not sure where to go from here. I'm really confused, I'm trying to figure out what's going on. I have a hard time trusting people, and now I realize that I shouldn't trust my own mind. I should be able to control my emotions, and yet

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Lara Jane Drake."
He nods, and then looks back at me. The silence stretches uncomfortably long between us. What should I say? How do I begin this conversation?   I've never had a therapist before, and I don't know what to expect. But I can tell by the expression on his face that something is wrong, and I feel myself becoming more anxious. It's not just the fact that we have nothing to talk about, but also because I want to help him, whatever his problem may be.
Finally, he breaks the silence, "Lara, would you mind telling me a little bit about yourself?"
I start to answer, and I realize that I haven't thought about my life since I woke up in the cave. Well, I guess I did think about my past a lot; I spent a good deal of time thinking about all the things that happened to me in my previous lives, and I wondered if I was supposed to be doing any of those things. I wonder if I was meant to meet up with my mother, or if she was merely a figment of my imagination. I ask myself, "Why am I alive, and where am I now?"
I'm not sure if I should tell the truth, or if I'm even allowed to tell the truth. I decide to err on the side of caution, "I was born in the United States in New York City, in Manhattan; I was raised in Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island; and I attended college at Columbia University for two years in the city. I went to medical school at NYU, and graduated in the top ten percent of my class. I interned at Mount Sinai Hospital for a year, and I worked there for a while. I'm married, and I have a daughter, and a son, and I live in the Bronx. I was a housewife, and I got divorced a few years ago. I'm a
