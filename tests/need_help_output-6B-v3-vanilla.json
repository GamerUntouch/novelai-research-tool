Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Samantha Jane Taylor.\"\nHe nods, encouragingly, waiting patiently for me to continue.\n\"I've been seeing a therapist since high school, and she suggested I try this other doctor. She said I had issues with intimacy. It wasn't until recently that I realized what she meant by 'intimacy.' My problem isn't really lack of desire or attraction...it's more like I have trouble opening up emotionally to people.\" I pause, wondering if that makes sense, then I go ahead anyway. \"It started when we were kids, playing spin the bottle. The game always ended up with one kid kissing another, and they'd blush and giggle afterwards. That was the last time I ever played spin the bottle. And now I can't get excited about sex, even though I want to very much. I just don't know how to do it right.\"\nDr. Szozas sits silently, listening intently. He looks deep into my eyes, searching for something. Finally he speaks, \"Samantha, I think that you should start by telling me about your sexual history. We'll talk about that after we finish discussing your current situation.\"\nSo I tell him all about myself: growing up with two older sisters, and not having any close friends; being shy and reserved; finding out that I was gay when I turned 18; coming out to my parents when I graduated college -- which resulted in an ugly divorce. I didn't date anyone while I went to grad school, because I knew that once I finished, I would be moving out to California. But when I finally moved out there, I found that most men seemed to be intimidated by me -- especially when I mentioned that I was an author.\nWhen I met Michael, things changed. I couldn't believe that he actually wanted me -- that he liked me, that he cared. When I told him that I loved him, I thought I might die from happiness.\n",

Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Melissa.\" And then I tell him why I've come:\nMelissa - Tuesday, September 20th\nHello again Dr. Szosas,\nThank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to meet with me today. You were very understanding, and patient. I really appreciate all that you have done for me already.\nYou said that you would explain what's happening to me. Well, I guess we can start there...\nSince last week, things started changing. The first change was that I started having trouble sleeping. It used to be easy, now I wake up almost constantly during the night. That isn't too bad, because once awake, I don't feel tired anymore. But when I do go back to sleep, I only get about an hour or two before waking up again.\nIt was getting worse, though. Last weekend, I couldn't even manage to stay asleep through most of the day. If I tried to nap, I'd just end up tossing and turning until I woke myself up. My mind feels foggy, unfocused; sometimes I think I hear voices talking to me, other times they seem real enough to be people. Sometimes I try to concentrate on something specific, but nothing comes to me.\nIn between those days, I would find myself staring out windows with a blank expression on my face, feeling disconnected from reality. This happened several times throughout the weekend, and each time I found myself wondering if this is what being crazy feels like?\nAnd it got much more intense yesterday. When I woke up, I felt completely refreshed. Everything seemed clearer, sharper, brighter than normal. Even though I had slept less than four hours, I didn't feel exhausted at all. I spent the entire day doing chores, and I never noticed any fatigue whatsoever. In fact, I barely remember anything about the day at all.\nAs I write this entry, I'm sitting at the dining room table with Dr. Sz",
