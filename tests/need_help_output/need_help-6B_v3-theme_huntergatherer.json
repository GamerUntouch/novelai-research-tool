Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

I feel myself getting flustered, and then I start talking. \"Well, I don't know what's wrong with me...\" I trail off. What do I say? How can I explain all of this?\nDr. Szozas leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees, and looks intently at me. \"Tell me more about the symptoms you've been experiencing since last week,\" he asks gently.\nSo I tell him about feeling tired, drowsy, irritable, unable to concentrate, wanting to sleep, having trouble sleeping, having dreams that are too vivid, and they seem to have become increasingly disturbing. \"Do any of those sound familiar to you?\" he inquires softly.\nThey sure do to me, and I answer, \"Yes. They do.\"\n\"How long have you had them?\"\n\"Since about Friday evening,\" I reply.\nDr. Szozas smiles again, \"And have you noticed anything different about your behavior during that time period?\"\nThis is a good question, and I think hard before responding, \"No. Nothing really. Just a little less energy than usual, maybe, but nothing dramatic.\"\n\"Have you ever experienced something similar to these symptoms prior to now?\"\nAgain, I pause to consider the question, and I decide to be honest, even though it feels like such an invasion of privacy. \"Yeah, once or twice. Not nearly as severe, but I did experience a few days like that when I was about 12 years old, when I was sick with the flu. That was the first time I remember being aware that I was 'different'.
