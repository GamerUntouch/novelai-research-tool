  "prompt": "I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",

My heart is pounding inside my chest, and I feel slightly dizzy. I need to get this right, because I don't want to say something stupid that will offend or annoy him. The last time I tried to tell people what was wrong with me, I got laughed at. It was horrible, and I felt humiliated and embarrassed. I never wanted to do anything like that again, especially not now. I really just want help.\nHe nods slowly, almost imperceptibly, \"Go ahead.\"\nI continue, \"Well, I've had a lot of problems lately, and I can't seem to figure them out on my own. I'm afraid I might hurt myself or others. I'm scared, and I don't know if I'll ever find the answers I seek. I keep trying, but I think I may be missing something important. I would very much appreciate any advice or guidance you could offer.   I'd also like to talk about my condition, if you're willing to listen to my story.  I hope you won't judge or laugh at me, but I am hoping for the best outcome possible for both of us.\"\nI stare at the floor, and wait for his reply.\nDr. Szozas responds, \"I understand where you are coming from, Caitlin, I truly do. I don't believe anyone should be ridiculed for their differences, or for being in pain. I promise you, I'm a good listener, and I assure you, I wouldn't ridicule you for having a difference.  I'm sure I can assist you in finding the answers you seek, and I look forward to hearing your story. Please, go on.\nI nod, \"Thank you. Well, I'm a 19 year old female, and I live in an apartment",

  "prompt": "I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",

Why don't you tell me what happened?\"\n\"Well, they got caught up in a terrorist bombing that took place at a mall in Los Angeles, California. They died instantly. It was horrible... their bodies just exploded...\"  I pause, trying to get my emotions under control, \"...and then there was blood everywhere, and I couldn't do anything. The people that attacked them had guns pointed at me, too. When the police arrived, I ran away... I hid in an alleyway until nightfall, and then I came home. I didn't know where else to go.\nWhen I woke up the next morning, I found myself in a hospital bed, surrounded by doctors and nurses. I asked one of the doctors for information about my parents, and she said I'd been involved in a car accident. I thought I remembered something similar happening, but I wasn't sure. I wanted to talk to my friend, but I lost her number. I looked online and found a listing for a doctor named Michael Szozas, and I emailed him. I've never met anyone like him before; he's a psychiatrist, and he sounds smart and wonderful. He recommended I come in for a consultation, and I agreed.\nI need help. I feel stuck in a rut, and I don't want to stay in the house all the time. I'm afraid of my neighbors, but I also miss my friends and my family. What should I do?\nDr. Szozas responds:\nCaitlin,\nI am very sorry for the loss of your parents. You are not alone in feeling trapped or frightened. Many people experience such feelings in times of great stress. I think the best thing you can do is to explore these issues in a safe environment, and",
