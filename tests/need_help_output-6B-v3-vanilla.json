Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

As I do, I can feel myself relax more and more as we talk. It feels good to have someone listen to me, even though they don't know what's wrong with me yet.\nWhen I finish explaining, Dr. Szozas asks, \"What do you think is going on? Is this something new or different from before?\"\nI reply, \"Yes, yes it is. Before now, I didn't realize anything was happening to me until recently. Now... well, I'm afraid to say that things are getting worse.\"\nDr. Szozas listens attentively as I tell him about the changes in my behavior, about the memory loss, the confusion, the anxiety. He asks questions, and I answer them honestly. When I get to the part where I had to call 911 because I couldn't remember how to drive home, he makes a note on his tablet computer.\n\"Can you describe the symptoms any further for me?\" he asks.\nSo I do, describing how I felt when I was having those episodes, and trying to figure out exactly what happened during each one. I also mention that I am experiencing some physical manifestations: nausea, dizziness, disorientation, sometimes weakness or muscle spasms.\nThen Dr. Szozas leans forward, and looks directly at me, his face serious and concerned, \"Kelly, is there anyone else that might be able to help us understand what's happening to you?\"\nIt occurs to me that I may be able to find an ally, or at least someone who understands, if I reach out to other people with similar problems.

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

But maybe Dr. Szozas would want to know more details. I decide to tell him the whole story.\nIt starts with the website that I found, which led me to Dr. Szazas. The next day, I went ahead and did what the site said: I sent an email to Dr. Szazas. And today I came in for my appointment.\nWhen I finish telling him all of this, Dr. Szozas looks at me thoughtfully, and he asks, \"Have you considered seeing anyone else?\"\n\"No,\" I answer honestly.\n\"Would you consider talking to me about any other issues that might have arisen?\"\nAgain, honesty wins out again, \"Yes, if there are any others.\"\n\"OK, let's get right to business,\" he responds, standing up and walking back over to his chair. He sits down, and places both hands together on top of them, resting them lightly atop each other. \"Marissa, when we talked earlier about 'problems', can you give me an example of one of those problems?\"\nI think for a minute, trying to figure out exactly what I'm experiencing, but I don't really understand it myself. So I try to explain it to Dr. Szozas. \"Well, um, I feel disconnected from everyone around me. Like no matter where I go, or who I'm with, something is missing, but I'm not sure what that is.

Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

But I want to know more about myself before I go any further with this process. \"Because...because...\" I stumble, \"Well, I don't know why, but it's important to me that people know who I really am.\"\nHe nods slowly, \"Go ahead, please continue.\"\nSo I start talking, telling him all about my life, and all about how I've been feeling lately. How I've felt different since last summer when we had our party, and how I still feel different now.\nDr. Szozas listens intently, taking notes as I speak. When I finish, he looks up from his notepad, and he responds, \"Thank you, Ms. Doe. You mentioned feeling different, what did you mean by that? What sort of differences were you experiencing?\"\n\"Oh gosh!\" I exclaim, \"That's hard to describe. It feels like there are things inside me, or maybe outside of me, that aren't mine. Like they are controlling my body, and sometimes making me act against my will. I also get headaches, and I just feel tired most days. And I'm scared about being alone. Sometimes I wake up at night, thinking that someone else is in bed with me, and I jump out of bed to check, but no one is there. It scares me.\"\nHe nods, \"And that was after your party, right?\"\nI nod yes, \"Yes sir. That happened right after the party, but I'm sure that I'd noticed some changes in me before that. I remember that I was having trouble sleeping, and I didn't enjoy sex with my husband anymore. I was getting mood",

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK.
