My name is Tina."
He nods, "And why did you contact me?"
It feels good to tell someone all this stuff, and I say, "Because I think something bad is happening to me, and I don't know what to do about it. And because I want to talk to somebody who knows more than me."
Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair, and lets out a long breath. He looks at me, and then turns to gaze out the window. "Tina, have you ever heard the term 'repetitive strain injury' before? No? Well, let me explain..."
* * *
So I was there at nine o'clock sharp, and I had been waiting patiently for ten minutes already. The receptionist greeted me politely, and she took my information, and gave me a form to fill out. She said, "Mr. Szatos will be with you shortly", and left me alone in the waiting room.
Ten minutes later, I hear a door open, and footsteps approach. A young woman enters the waiting area, wearing a white lab coat. Her hair is pulled into a ponytail, her face is pretty with an attractive smile. "Hello Tina, I'm Doctor Szatos, pleased to meet you," he extends his hand to shake mine. I stand up to greet him, and I extend a hand too, and we shake hands. He smiles, and asks me to follow him to his office.
In his office is a small round table with two chairs, and a wall lined with bookshelves. He closes the office door behind us, and gestures me to a chair. I sit down, and he begins talking, "Well, Tina, I'm going to ask you a few questions, just to get a sense of where you are mentally. I'm not a psychologist, but I can give you a referral if you need one. So... I'd like you to

My name is Alice, I'm 19 years old, and I'm having trouble adjusting to life after high school."
He nods, "How long have you been feeling this way?"
"Since last week."
"And where do you live now? In town or country?"
"In town."
"Do you work anywhere else?"
"No, just part time at the library during summer break."
"So what brings you here today?"
"Well, I was watching TV one night when I saw something that seemed odd. It wasn't until later that I realized what had happened, but it was really strange... I don't know if anyone would believe me, but..."
"Alice, please tell me exactly what you saw on television, starting with when you were watching it."
"Alright then, let's see... I was lying there on the sofa, trying to watch a movie, when all of a sudden I felt myself falling asleep. The next thing I knew I was standing outside the house in front of the garage, looking up at the sky. There were stars everywhere, but they weren't normal stars, they looked more like fireflies or glowing bugs."
"Did anything happen while you were awake between the moment you fell asleep and the moment you woke up?"
"Not that I can remember."
Dr. Szozas looks at me with his deep brown eyes, "You said that the 'firefly' stars didn't look right to you, but did you think that they should look different?"
"Yes, I thought that the stars shouldn't be floating freely in the air, but instead be attached to a ceiling, or a wall, or maybe even a tree branch. I tried to move them, but nothing happened. They stayed still. I couldn't feel any wind either; it was completely silent out there, except for the occasional sound of insects buzzing about."
Dr. Szozas stares at me with

My name is Kathleen 'Kathy' Cavanaugh."
He nods, waiting patiently, "And why have you come?"
"Well...it all started yesterday..."
He raises an eyebrow at this, "Yesterday? What happened yesterday?"
Oh shit. This is where it starts getting dicey again, "I had been working hard today, and then suddenly, I just felt weird. It was like something snapped inside me, and I couldn't think straight anymore. I went home early because I didn't know what else to do, and then I got really sick. I vomited repeatedly, and threw up until there was nothing left in my stomach, and I collapsed. When I woke up, I felt completely different than I did before I passed out. My body feels heavy, sluggish, lethargic, weak, and tired. And now I can't remember anything after I ate lunch last week. I feel detached somehow, and my mind is fuzzy. Like, if I try to concentrate too hard on one thing, my thoughts drift off into another direction. There are times when I don't even recognize myself. Sometimes I wake up feeling confused about what day it is or what time it is, and sometimes I'm not sure what I've done during the course of the night. I'm afraid that I'm losing my memory again. I'm scared that I'll forget about my kids, my husband, my friends, and everyone I care about. I want to go back to normal, but I don't understand what's happening to me."
Dr. Szozas sits silently for a moment, "Tell me more about the symptoms that you are experiencing, please."
So I tell him about the headaches I get at the beginning of the month; the difficulty concentrating; the nausea; the exhaustion; the dizziness; the blurred vision; the lack of appetite; the weight gain; and the constant itching.
"That sounds like a severe case of depression

My name is Katrina Schnee."
He nods slightly, then looks back at me, "And what brings you to our little clinic?"
"Well..." I start to say, "I have this... problem. It's been happening since I was young, and it keeps getting worse. And I've tried talking to people about it, but nobody wants to listen. They just think I'm crazy, or stupid. Or both."
Dr. Szozas smiles again, "So tell me more about what happens."
"It started when I was seven years old. My parents were very religious, and they didn't want me to play with other children because we weren't supposed to touch them or talk to them. But I was curious, and I wanted to know what their voices sounded like, so I snuck away one day to go play outside. When I got there, I found all sorts of kids playing together, laughing and having fun. I went home feeling really happy, until I realized that something was wrong with me.
"Everything changed after that. Everything felt strange to me. I couldn't stop thinking about those kids, and I had trouble sleeping at night. The weirdest part is that when I'm alone, I don't feel any different than normal. I can't explain it, but I feel so empty inside. I get scared sometimes, and I always have nightmares. I keep waking up screaming. Sometimes I wake up crying. I never knew I would be able to control these things, but I do. I'm not sure how to describe it exactly, but I'm better at it now. I'm afraid to leave the house, though I need to work to support myself and pay my bills.
"That's why I came to see a psychiatrist. I thought maybe I could figure out a way to deal with the problems that I'm experiencing. I'm hoping that if I find out how I can control it, I'll be

My name is Rosemary."  Dr. Szozas smiles kindly, and nods. "And why have you chosen to visit me?"
"Well, because... uhm..." What can I tell this guy? I don't know what's wrong with me. But maybe I'll just start with the beginning. "It all started two weeks ago, after I had sex with one of the boys from school. And then I got pregnant."
He looks startled, "You did?"
"Yes." I say, trying not to sound too defensive. "We didn't use protection. It was our senior year, we were both virgins, and we thought there would never be another opportunity like this again, so we went ahead and took each other inside us. We'd been dating for months, but this was special. The boy I slept with is named Chris, and he's really cute. He's also popular with girls, which I think is a big part of what made me go along with it. Anyway, when I came home the next day, everyone knew about it, and they teased me mercilessly. They called me a slut, and said that I should've used condoms. That was the final straw; I couldn't stand any more humiliation. I broke up with Chris, and I haven't seen him since. I guess I'm still in shock about everything that happened. I feel empty inside, and I'm scared that I might be crazy or something."
Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding his head occasionally. "So that's why I'm here, to get help. I'm not sure if I'm crazy or not, but I'm definitely having problems. I'm afraid to leave the house, I'm seeing things that aren't real, I'm hearing voices, I'm having nightmares about being raped, I'm losing weight, I'm crying a lot, I'm feeling depressed, I'm angry at myself for getting

My name is Misha McBride."
He nods, and then turns back to face me, leaning forward slightly, elbows resting on knees, hands clasped together, waiting patiently for me to continue. It feels good to have this person listening to me, taking time to understand what I say.
"I've been having trouble sleeping lately, and I can't seem to get past three o'clock without falling asleep," I begin.
"Have you had any problems with sleep before?" asks Dr. Szozas.
"No, nothing really bad. But recently, I've started waking up very early each morning, usually by four or five AM, and I don't feel rested when I wake up. Sometimes I just lay there, staring at the ceiling until I remember where I am, and realize that I need to go to work. I don't want to be late. And I know I'm not supposed to be awake this early, but I keep thinking that maybe I should try to sleep later instead of earlier. I feel anxious about being tired when I go to bed at night. I used to be able to sleep soundly all through the night, but now I have trouble getting to sleep at all. My dreams are vivid and disturbing, sometimes even frightening me awake. They are also unusually vivid, almost too real, as if they are happening right in front of me. I find myself remembering them after I awaken. I haven't taken anything to help me sleep yet, but I'd like to if I can figure out which one to use. I guess I'm trying to decide whether to ask you about a prescription for Ambien, or something else, like a sedative?
Dr. Szozas responds, "Tell me about your dreams, and how long you've been having these difficulties. Can you tell me about the details of your nightmares?"
"Well, I dream about a lot of things. Some are scary, but most are

My name is Chip." The doctor nods slowly, waiting patiently until I continue.
"Chip... uh, I don't know exactly where to start," I say, trying to find words, and then I realize what I should have done long ago: I should have taken notes. But there wasn't time. There isn't much time left now, either.
"Tell me more about your problem," prompts the good Doctor, gently.
So I begin. I tell him all about my life since childhood, my schooling, and my career. I talk about my wife, Susan, and our son, Tommy. I talk about my job at the factory, and how I work hard and do a great job. I even mention the fact that I was recently promoted to foreman.
Then I get to the part that I really want to talk about. I describe my recent discovery of the web, and how I've been having problems with my memory lately, and I can't remember things that happened yesterday or earlier this week. And I feel guilty about it because I think maybe it's something wrong with me.
Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding periodically while I speak. When I finish speaking, the psychiatrist asks, "What did the doctors say?"
I shrug, "They said they couldn't figure out what was causing it."
He sits back in his chair, "Do you have any other symptoms? Problems with sleeping, concentration, mood swings, anything else that might be related to the issue?"
I shake my head, "No. I'm pretty normal otherwise."
The psychiatrist leans forward, "And when was the last time that you had a complete physical exam, by a physician?"
I scratch my nose nervously, "Uh, I'm not sure. I just got married a few months ago, and I haven't gone to the doctor yet. I'm a little nervous about that. I didn't think I needed one before

My name is Rita Harker." I pause, wondering where this might lead. I feel very uncomfortable with all this attention being paid to me, and I can't think straight. This doctor seems too good to be true. Why would anyone want to go through all this trouble? Is there something wrong with me?
He responds calmly, "What brings you to our offices today?"
This question makes me even more uneasy, because I don't know what else to say. I try again, "Well, uhm..."
"Rita, please just start by telling me what brought you to us today. We'll get to any questions later."
So I tell him about the web site, the email correspondence, and the appointment time. I also tell him about my frustration and anxiety at work, and about the nightmares that have been plaguing me lately.
"You seem rather upset about this whole thing. Are you sure it's not related to your recent divorce?" he asks gently.
"No... I've never felt better than I do right now," I reply honestly. "But I'm still worried about it, maybe I should talk to someone after all."
"Let me ask you a few things to help me understand your situation. You mentioned that the nightmares started about six months ago. Can you remember anything about them before that point? Did they ever stop or decrease in intensity until then?"
I shake my head, "Not really. They were always bad dreams, but I didn't wake up feeling refreshed or rested, I was scared out of my mind most times. I guess I was hoping that the nightmares had finally stopped, but I wasn't getting much sleep either way."
"Do the nightmares usually involve some kind of animal attack scenario?"
"Yes, but sometimes I dream about people. I was having one about a couple of weeks ago when I was working late, I was dreaming about a woman I worked with. She'd

My name is Victoria Winters." I pause, then continue, "and... uh..." I feel awkward saying this next part, "well, I have been having strange dreams lately. And they seem more vivid than usual, and they don't fade away after waking. It's really starting to affect my work life, and I think I need help." My face feels hot, and I can hear my heart beating fast.
He smiles, nodding slowly, "And what do those dreams involve?"
It's hard to talk about them now. They are very personal, and I've never discussed them before with anyone except maybe myself. But there's something about Dr. Szozas that makes me want to tell him about them. I try to speak clearly and concisely, "Well, um, I dreamt that I was married to my husband, Michael, but we were both being controlled by another person. The other person was also controlling my daughter, too. She had a lot of black hair, and she looked just like me. Her name is Karen, though I call her Kiki. She was telling us all sorts of things about our lives, and making fun of us at the same time. It felt real, but I knew that I wasn't dreaming, because I couldn't wake up. I'm not sure if I'm awake or asleep right now." I'm surprised at the tears that come to my eyes, and I start to sob a little, trying to hold back the emotion.
Dr. Szozas gets up from his chair, coming to kneel beside me, "Victoria, I'm sorry if I upset you. I didn't know that you had these problems. I'm not sure that I understand exactly what you are describing, but I will certainly look into it further. I'll be calling you later today to schedule an appointment with me, OK? Can I ask you a couple of questions to get a better idea of what might be

My name is Sandra Winters."
He nods slowly, "And why did you decide to seek treatment?"
I answer, "Well... because I've been having nightmares lately. Nightmares where I am being chased by something, but I can't find any place to hide..."
"That sounds familiar," he replies, and I feel my heart leap into my throat. Is this good? I ask myself, but then he continues, "Can you tell me more about those dreams?"
So I do. I talk about the bad things happening to me, the threats against me, the people trying to kill me. The details are all there: the blood, the screams, the pain. And the fear. I describe what happened to me last night, and I even give him a brief description of what I saw when I looked into the mirror. It was horrible. I thought that maybe I should have stayed away from mirrors altogether.
When I finish talking, he sits back, thinking deeply. "Do you know anything about yourself that might explain these feelings?" he asks, finally breaking the silence after several minutes.
I shake my head, not wanting to admit that I don't really understand myself very well yet. But I think about it, and I realize that I'm afraid of the dark, that I hate crowds, that I'm scared to go out alone at night. I'm terrified of spiders, which I haven't had since I was a kid. I'm scared of heights, I'm scared of dogs (even though I own one), I'm afraid of the ocean, I'm afraid of the rain, I'm afraid of the sun, I'm afraid of the sky, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of bugs, I'm afraid of the darkness, I'm afraid to eat, I'm afraid to drink, I'm afraid to sleep, I'm afraid to be touched, I'm afraid to be left out, I'm afraid to
