Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

Do you recall leaving home?\"\n\"Yes, I left home right after dinner. It was late, almost midnight, I think. The drive home was uneventful.\"\n\"Do you have any idea where you were headed when you got there?\"\n\"No. But I was exhausted, I just wanted to get inside the house, lay down on the bed, close my eyes, and go to sleep.\" I pause. \"But when I walked into the living room, I saw something strange.\"\nDr. Szozas raises an eyebrow at me, patiently waiting for me to continue.\n\"There was a woman sitting in the recliner chair, watching television. She looked familiar, but I couldn't place her face.\"\n\"What did she look like?\"\n\"She had long blonde hair, parted to one side, and the top part swept to the middle of her forehead. Her hair fell past her shoulders to the floor, and I noticed that she wore a dark green dress with a high neckline.

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Alice.\" And then I tell him my story. It all spills out of me, a torrent of words, thoughts, feelings, memories... and they pour out onto the page of this letter.\nHe listens patiently until I've finished speaking, and then asks, \"Do you want to talk more?\"\nAnd I say, \"Yes, please.\"\nSo we do. We discuss my childhood, my adolescence, my marriage, my divorce, my life before meeting Mr. X. I describe the strange behavior I have exhibited since I met him, the things I did, the way I acted, the dreams I had. He nods sagely throughout, making notes on his legal pad. When I finish talking, he looks up at me with those brilliant eyes. \"Alice, can I ask you something? Do you think there's any chance that you might be suffering from an acute stress reaction?\"\nThat stops me cold. My mouth opens slightly, \"What? No! Why would I be having such a reaction? What does that even mean?\"\n\"It means exactly what it sounds like: that you are experiencing extreme emotional distress, and you may not be aware of the cause of it. In fact, I'd say that you are most likely to be suffering from a severe case of denial, which is a type of mental illness that I specialize in.\"\nDenial? That's insane. I'm not crazy; I know that. I look at the doctor. His face is unreadable; his gaze is calm and clear.\n\"But I'm telling the truth!\" I protest.\nDr. Szozas smiles gently, \"You don't believe me, but I assure you, I'm a specialist in this field. I'm also a psychiatrist who specializes in treating patients with unusual problems. I'm sure that if I were to examine you, I could prove to you that you are indeed suffering from a severe case of denial.\"\n\"No",

Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it.

Tell me more.\" And then he leans forward in his chair, and listens intently to what I have to say.\nAs I talk, I realize that he's not really listening, but instead he appears absorbed in watching me. The way his gaze moves slowly across my body gives me a shiver. As I speak, I can't help noticing the fact that he hasn't touched anything except the tips of his fingers. It makes me self-conscious, because it seems almost sexual, and I try to stop talking too fast.\nDr. Szozas doesn't seem bothered by my discomfort; in fact, I'm getting the sense that he finds it fascinating. He watches me with a smile playing about his lips, which is making me even hotter than before. I don't know if it's the lighting or something else, but his hair looks different somehow.
