=== Prompt ========================================
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "

=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Baret Emerald." And then I pause again before continuing, "And... uh..." I glance nervously at Dr. Szozas.
He nods encouragingly, "You can start by telling me where you live."
This question makes me uncomfortable. I feel like I've done something wrong. What if he thinks I'm crazy? But I answer, "Somerset County, Massachusetts."
"What do you do?" asks Dr. Szozas, his face serious now.
"Well, I work at a bank, actually, but I want to move away from there soon."
"Where did you go to school?"
"Oh, I went to high school in Massachusetts too, but I transferred after freshman year to a community college nearby. I'm thinking of transferring to another state university this coming semester."
Dr. Szozas looks surprised. "That sounds like quite an accomplishment, considering you were only eighteen when you started college."
"Yeah, I guess so." My mind wanders back to my time at Somerset Community College. It was a good place, but I had to quit because my family moved away from the area, and I couldn't afford the tuition anymore.
"So tell me about your life since leaving home," prompts the psychiatrist.
We talk about the past few months; I explain that I met a girl named Morgan at a party, and we became friends, and I'd been seeing her for a while. I also mention that she broke up with me, but I'm still hung up on her. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm confused. I'm depressed. I'm angry. I'm sad. I'm horny. I'm scared. I'm confused. I'm frustrated. I'm anxious. I'm horny. I'm confused. I'm lonely. I'm horny. I'm confused. I'm sad. I'm horny. I'm confused. I'm horny

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Emerald Bodington." The silence lingers uncomfortably long between us before I continue, "You asked me to tell you why I was there?"
He nods, "Yes, please do."
So I go on, telling him everything: My father's death, my mother's breakdowns, my brother's suicide, the inheritance money I received, the strange dreams... then I ask, "What does all this have to do with me being here? What am I supposed to learn?"
Dr. Szozas smiles kindly, "Well, let's start by discussing your parents, shall we?" He asks softly, "Did they ever talk about anything other than their work?"
"No," I answer honestly.
"And did they seem happy together?"
"They were always smiling..." I pause to think about that, "...sometimes too much, I guess."
Dr. Szozas nods slowly, "Do you recall any specific incidents that might help explain what was happening with them?"
"Sure," I say, recalling one incident when I walked into the kitchen to find Mom crying. She looked up at me, her face wet with tears, and she said, 'It's just so hard to be a good wife to a man like that.'
"How would you describe your dad?"
"'A great man,' I'd say. We both loved our jobs, and we enjoyed each other very much. And I thought I had the perfect life."
"That sounds wonderful, but I need to know more about the things that happened with your mom after that comment."
"She seemed really sad about something. I tried to figure out if I knew what it was, but I couldn't get a handle on it. I remember that I went to bed that night feeling bad about not knowing the reason for the sadness that I saw in her eyes. But I woke up that morning and I felt better, happier even. It

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Emerald Berington." I pause again, then continue, "and I came here because..." My words trail off, because there's really nothing more to say than this: I just want help. But I don't know what else to do.
He smiles broadly, and nods, encouragingly, "That sounds good to me, let's start by getting you oriented...okay?"
Orientation? What does that even mean? Is he talking about the orientation I took when I went to college? The one where they showed us all the buildings and stuff? Well, yeah, I guess I can figure that much out. I nod.
Dr. Szozas continues, "You've been having problems since last week, right?"
Last week?! He's referring to my email to him! How did he get my address?! I glance at the ceiling, and I feel myself blushing. I'm not sure if he noticed or not. It doesn't matter though; I should have known better than to send something personal like that out.
Dr. Szozas chuckles, "Well, that was quite an interesting piece of correspondence." And now his smile broadens, "But I think we'll save that discussion for later; I'd rather talk about your current situation."
Ohhh, that's good to hear. I relax a little; maybe I shouldn't worry about that whole thing after all.
"So tell me about your current situation," he prompts gently, and I begin to describe the problem that I am facing. I explain that I am unable to stop thinking about sex, and that I am feeling extremely horny, almost constantly. I also explain that I am seeing flashes of people I used to be intimate with, and that I am experiencing intense feelings of jealousy when I am with other women.
He listens intently to me as I go through the story; I notice that he is nodding along with me,

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Baret Emeraldia."
He nods, then asks, "And why are you here?"
Again I pause, unsure what to say next... I think about my life, and where it's been headed lately. I feel myself slipping away, losing control. The thought of suicide crosses my mind, and it scares me more than anything else. If this doctor can help me, maybe I'll have a chance. Maybe there's something wrong with me, and I don't even know it yet. My heart races, I shake, and I sweat profusely. It feels like I've just run five miles uphill.
"Barrett, please tell me exactly why you're here today? What do you want to talk about?" He prompts gently.
"Well..." I begin slowly, trying to find words to describe the feeling inside me. "I'm not sure what to call it, but I seem to be having trouble with controlling my emotions. I get angry easily, and I lose track of reality. When I go outside, I keep thinking about things that aren't real, or I might start crying uncontrollably if I'm left alone too long. Sometimes I can't remember where I am for a while after I leave a place. I guess I'm a little lost sometimes, I need help to figure out who I am. And I'm scared to be by myself all the time." I stop talking and look at the ground; I don't really understand any of that. I wish I had a friend to share it with, but I have none. I look back up at Dr. Szozas' face, and I wait to hear his reply.
The psychiatrist sits quietly, absorbing my story. "Tell me about the first incident that brought you here," he directs.
"It was about two weeks ago when I was at the mall with my sister, we were going to the food court when I saw her boyfriend with another girl

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Emerald Baret."
He smiles again, this time more broadly, and nods, "And tell me, what brings you here today?"
"Well..." I begin, but then pause. I know that there is something wrong with me, but I don't have any idea what it is. I've been feeling off all day, and I just feel... odd. My mind feels fuzzy. And now that I'm sitting across from Dr. Szosas, I can't stop thinking about him, wondering if I should kiss him right now. It's crazy! This isn't the way I usually behave, but I'm not myself.
Dr. Szozas clears his throat, "Tell me about yourself."
So I do. I describe my family history, where I grew up, high school experiences, even college life. I'm surprised by the fact that I didn't mention anything about being a pirate until after we'd finished our discussion. I explain that I had heard rumors of pirates before coming to the island, but they were nothing compared to reality. But I also admit that I was curious about them, so I decided to come out here to find out if the stories were true or false.
But then I realize that I haven't mentioned the reason I wanted to go to the island, and I feel embarrassed. I'm sure that he knows that I want to become a doctor when I graduate from medical school, but I still keep the secret. I'm afraid that I might be judged because I'm a woman.
"What about relationships? Do you have a boyfriend?"
This question throws me completely; I hadn't considered that I would need to answer this question. I blush slightly, "No." I say softly.
"Have you ever thought about having a relationship with a man?"
Again I'm stunned; I wasn't expecting that to be asked. I stammer, "Yes, but I wouldn't want

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Baret Emeraldia."
He nods thoughtfully, "And why have you chosen this particular name?"
I pause again, wondering how much information should be given to this stranger? And then I decide, "Well, since I don't know where else to go, I guess I'll tell you what happened. First off, I think maybe I'm bipolar, or something similar. The last few weeks have been very hard for me. I've had trouble sleeping, and I can't seem to keep myself focused. I also feel depressed most of the time, and I have trouble concentrating. I'm just not sure if there's anything wrong with me or not. It might help if I knew more about...well..."
Dr. Szozas leans forward, "It sounds to me like you may be experiencing symptoms of clinical depression. This is quite common in young people today. Have you ever considered talking to a therapist about this?"
I nod slowly, "Yeah, I'm thinking about seeing one soon. But before I do that, I wanted to ask you about something else. I saw a website called 'Huffington Post', and they said that you specialize in unusual cases. Is this true?"
Dr. Szozas smiles at me, and then his face grows serious, "Yes, I am indeed well-known for helping those with mental disorders such as yours."
I smile back at him, relieved that I wasn't crazy after all. I look at him expectantly.
"Tell me about the events that led up to your current state, and about the problems that you are currently having."
So I start to talk about the things that I remember happening, the oddities that I experienced, and the strange feelings that I am now feeling. I describe the dreams that I am having, the nightmares that I am having, the way that I am acting out the daydreams that I am having. I confess that I

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Baret Silverman."
He nods, then asks, "And where do you live?"
"New York City," I say.
"How long have you been there?"
"About six months now."
"You seem very calm right now, Mr. Silverman... Are you worried? Worried about anything specific?"
"Well..." I start, unsure if this doctor knows what he's talking about, "I've had a lot of dreams lately, vivid ones that feel real."
"Dreams?" He raises an eyebrow, leaning forward slightly. "Do they involve sex or violence?"
"No," I answer honestly, "they just seem real, though sometimes they aren't all that pleasant."
Dr. Szozas looks thoughtful for a moment, before responding, "Tell me more about them. What happens in them?"
So I tell him about the dream I woke up having last night, and about my recurring nightmare since childhood, when my parents would fight, and the one time I was home alone with Dad after Mom left us to go visit her sister. I tell him about the nightmares I had while living with Auntie Beth, and the fear that crept into me whenever she yelled at me. I describe the few times I tried to talk to a counselor, but they were always dismissive, and I never felt better afterward. I don't mention the rape I experienced at the hands of a stranger, because I didn't want to sound crazy.
When I finish, Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair and thinks for a minute, tapping his pen against his lips.
Then he speaks, "Mr. Silverman, I think we need to look at some things together. I'm going to ask you some questions that might help me understand the nature of the problems you are experiencing. Please be honest with me; if you lie, I'll know it. If you are not completely truthful, I will

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Baret Emerald." I pause, thinking back to my father telling me this story... "and I've been having trouble sleeping lately."
He nods, "Yes, sleep problems can cause all sorts of other issues. We'll start there, then we will move onto more general concerns."
And so I begin, "Well, I have been experiencing strange dreams..."
Dr. Szozas raises one eyebrow, "Strange?"
I nod, "Yeah, they aren't just weird, they feel real, but they seem impossible to recall after waking up. It feels like I'm dreaming, but when I try to remember them, nothing comes to mind."
Dr. Szozas pauses, "Hmm. Do you know if anyone else has had similar experiences? Perhaps you might share those memories with us, when you get a chance."
So I tell him about the dream I had last night where I was a pirate captain, and how I'd heard about a treasure chest that held an ancient artifact called the Eye of Ra. And I describe what happened next.
When I finish talking about that part, Dr. Szozas asks, "Have you ever felt like something is missing? Like you are forgetting things, or not remembering details correctly?"
I shake my head, "No, not really. I don't think I am losing anything important, but I do sometimes wonder about small details that I'm sure I would never forget. I'm not sure I should trust myself when I'm doing simple tasks, like tying a shoelace or taking out the trash."
"Do you find yourself distracted by thoughts during the day, perhaps about the past or future?"
Again, I shake my head, "Not really. I guess I'm not much different than normal, except that I'm tired a lot of the time, but I am also a little bit irritated at times when I can't concentrate properly. I wish I could figure out

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Baret Bemotus." The moment I say this, I realize something: It feels strange speaking those words aloud. As though they don't belong to me anymore. And yet, I feel more confident than ever before. Perhaps I have been waiting all my life for this day? Maybe I've always known that I would meet Dr. Szozas someday...and now that time has finally arrived, I feel almost giddy inside. My heart flutters with excitement, and I can hardly contain myself.
Dr. Szozas leans forward and looks intently at me, "Tell me what brought you to me today?"
This question catches me off guard, because I hadn't really thought through the details. I had just walked in and sat down, hoping to find a solution to whatever was wrong with me. Now that I think about it, I do remember a few things. There was a dream I'd had last night where I saw the doctor in front of me. He seemed very old then, with white hair, and dark circles under his eyes. In the dream, I said to him "You were right. You knew me when I was young. I need help."
And then I woke up, and I felt different. Different enough to email Dr. Szozas to ask if he might be able to help me. I guess that means I'm not crazy after all.
But the memory is fuzzy, and I don't know if it's a real recollection or not. But I want to believe that I did talk to the doctor, that I did tell him about the dreams and that he helped me. That's why I'm here, isn't it?
"Well, I'm not sure exactly how to explain this, but I seem to be experiencing a lot of changes lately. I'm having difficulty sleeping at night; I'm finding it hard to concentrate during the day; I keep thinking about the past; I

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Beckett Baret." The doctor nods and writes this down on a pad next to his computer monitor. It looks like there is something else written beside this entry, but I can't quite tell what it is yet. He turns back to face me, and asks, "Beckett...what brings you here?"
Oh god, he knows already? I feel embarrassed, like I've been caught doing something wrong. But then I realize that I have nothing to hide. I relax and answer honestly, "It all started after the accident."
He raises an eyebrow, "Accident? What do you mean by 'accident?'"
"Well..." I begin, pausing briefly before continuing, "A few months ago, I was involved in an auto accident. A drunk driver hit us head-on, we were both killed instantly. My wife was pregnant at the time, and our unborn child was also killed." I pause again, and swallow hard. "The baby girl died too, she didn't survive the crash."
Dr. Szozas sits quietly, listening to me intently as I continue talking. He doesn't interrupt, nor does he show any sign of judgement or pity. In fact, his expression remains neutral the entire time I talk about the incident.
After I finish speaking, I look up at him, waiting for his reaction. I don't know if I should expect a sympathetic outburst, a sigh, a smile, a frown, anything. Instead I'm met with a calm gaze that stares right through me, examining everything about me. I sense that he is not judging me, but instead is simply absorbing the information that I'm giving him.
At last, he speaks up, his voice quiet but clear, "So, I understand that you are experiencing feelings of grief related to the death of your family members?"
"Yes, sir," I reply, nodding my head slightly.
"Have you spoken with anyone about
