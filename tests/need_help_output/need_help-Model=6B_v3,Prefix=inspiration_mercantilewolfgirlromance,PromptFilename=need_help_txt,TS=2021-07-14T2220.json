  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

That's what everyone calls me.\"\nHe nods slowly, \"And why are you here?\"\nI tell him my story, beginning with my childhood, then moving forward to where I find myself now. I explain that this isn't something that can be fixed by any medical intervention. It's more than just being depressed, or even having anxiety. I feel like there is nothing inside of me anymore, that I have been hollowed out.\nWhen I finish speaking, Dr. Szozas sits quietly for a while before saying, \"Well, we'll get started tomorrow morning. First off, let me ask you: Do you believe that God exists?\"\nIt catches me off guard, and I say, \"Um...\"\nHe smiles again, \"You don't have to answer right away if you want. If you'd rather wait until after our session, that would be fine too.\"\nThat settles it; I do not need time to think about anything else. \"God does exist, yes. I know that He is real because of all the miracles that happen in my life.

As if an invisible hand is trying to tear me apart.\n\"...like I am being torn up from within.\"\n\"Hmm...\"\nAs I talk, Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair and leans forward slightly, his hands clasped together. His lips are pursed in thought, and I realize that I must look just as perplexed to him.\nHe stands up, \"Let me ask you a few questions. Have you ever felt that something was tearing you up from the inside?\"\n\"No...not really.\"\n\"Have you ever experienced anything similar to that? Any hallucinations, or hearing voices?\"\n\"Not that I recall.

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

The last time I gave another name was when I registered myself as a merchant with the guild. This was because they wanted all merchants to use their own names instead of using the common ones. It was also due to the fact that we had received many complaints about people trying to steal our goods.\nWhen I give this information, Dr. Szozas nods, \"And?\"\nSo I continue, \"You know what happened to me yesterday, right? And you probably already heard about what happened today. Well...\" I feel awkward talking about my condition, but I can't help it. \"Well...it feels like I'm having some sort of seizure or something.\"\nDr. Szozas smiles gently and responds, \"Yes, that sounds very much like what you might experience during an episode. Let me ask you a few questions, shall I?\"\nHe asks me to tell him about the incident where I went crazy, and I do. When I finish, he looks at me with a gentle smile, and he asks me to explain exactly what I meant when I said that I felt like I was possessed.\n\"But I didn't say anything to anyone! I just got angry at the shopkeeper!\" I exclaim.\n\"That's fine, but the issue is that the way you acted was different from usual. You were speaking to no one, but your words seemed to be directed at them.

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

The room is stuffy.\n\"Well, since we've already met, I thought I should tell you something before we meet again.\"\n\"...What do you mean? What do you know about me?\" I blurt out nervously.\nDr. Szozas chuckles gently, and then sits back in his chair. He looks at me intently for a moment, and then speaks, \"Holo, let me explain something to you...\"\nIt begins.\n◇ ◇ ◇\n\"So, what exactly do you want to talk about?\"\nDr. Szozas asks me this after I have finished telling him everything: where I came from, what happened to me, and even about my current situation.\nWhen I was done talking, Dr. Szozas just sat there silently, nodding occasionally, his expression unchanging. It took me a while to realize that I had been speaking too much. But now that I think about it, I'm not sure if I actually said anything worth listening to.\nAs I stare at his unreadable expression, I feel a little ashamed that I couldn't say more than \"Uh huh, uh huh\", but I also find myself thinking that I probably don't need to be saying all that much either.\nAfter a few moments of silence, I try to break the ice by asking, \"Did I answer your questions satisfactorily enough?\"\n\"Yes, I believe that you have answered them well enough to begin with. You are a very interesting case indeed, Holo the Wisewolf. I would like to hear your story, but I must warn you that I am a busy man. I will be happy to give you an appointment to come visit me at the clinic, but I cannot promise that I can provide",
