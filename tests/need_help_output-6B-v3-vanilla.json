   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Elizabeth Jane Smith.\" And then I pause, wondering if this will even matter, but then I continue, \"And I'm here because I have been having strange dreams, feelings, thoughts, emotions... things...\"\nHe nods encouragingly, and asks, \"Can you tell me what those are?\"\nI consider my options carefully, weighing them against each other. If I were to tell him all of it, would he believe me? Would he think I was crazy or something? But then again, if I don't say anything, maybe he'll dismiss me without listening to me. Maybe I should just keep quiet and let him decide whether or not to listen to me.\n\"Well,\" I begin hesitantly, \"In one dream, I'm standing outside in front of a building, but there's nothing there, no sign, no people, no cars, no buildings, no trees, nothing except an empty lot. It's pitch black out, and there are stars overhead, but they aren't any where else. There are lights coming from inside the building, but I can't get to it; I've tried to go through the door, but it won't open. I walk up to the window and try to look inside, but I can't see anything. I turn away, and start walking back to my car, but when I do, I hear voices talking about me. They know who I am, but I don't recognize their voices or faces. They are saying that they want me to come into the building, but when I look at it, I realize that it isn't really there anymore. All that is left is the empty lot. The only thing that is real is me, and that is going to be taken away soon.\nThen another time, I am driving along, and I suddenly find myself at a stoplight. I glance at the light, and I feel that I need to move forward, but when I look",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Amy Lee.\" And then I pause again, because I have to think hard before continuing, and I decide to just blurt it all out: \"You know...I've been having dreams...\"\nAnd there it goes, the whole story spilled out onto his lap. The dream starts with the big reveal: I'm naked, lying on top of a bed, staring back at myself. My body is covered in tattoos, both real ones and symbols. It's strange because they seem to change slightly each time I wake up from the dream. There's always something different about them, and sometimes I can even remember what symbol represents what part of my anatomy, but most of the time I don't really understand what any of them say or do. But I'm not sure if this is normal. This is followed by the usual sequence of events: getting undressed, getting laid, etc.\nBut now we get to the weirdest parts. Sometimes I'm alone, other times I'm joined by another girl. Other times, I'm joined by two girls. More often than not, though, I'm joined by three girls (and one guy), and I feel awkward being surrounded by so many women. They keep trying to talk to me, but I never quite hear their voices. Then suddenly I realize that I'm dreaming, and that I am awake -- but somehow I still find myself trapped inside the dream.\nWhen Dr. Szozas asks me about the details, I tell him about the tattooed bodies. He nods his head knowingly, but I wonder if he understands.\nThe next day, Dr. Szozas tells me that he'll schedule an appointment with me at his office, and that he'd like me to bring along a list of questions that I might want to ask him. He also mentions that he would be interested in talking with my friends, too. After that, I go home and write out a long, detailed list of things",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Jillian Sorenson.\" I pause for a moment, then add, \"I've been having problems sleeping lately, and I don't know what else to do, I just feel tired all the time...\" My words trail off, and I continue, \"...and...confused?\"\nHe nods slowly, and leans forward slightly, \"You seem very upset, Jillian, can we start by getting you something to drink? Coffee perhaps? Or tea?\"\n\"Coffee would be great, thank you,\" I reply.\n\"Excellent choice,\" he smiles broadly, and gets up to get us both coffee. We chat idly for awhile before returning to our seats.\nAs we sip our drinks, Dr. Szozas asks, \"Jillian, have you ever had any mental health issues before now?\"\n\"No,\" I say, \"nothing like this, not really. Just a few times I felt depressed or anxious, but nothing serious.\"\n\"Have you tried talking to anyone about what's going on with you?\"\n\"Yes,\" I answer, \"but they didn't help much. They said that I was fine, but I wasn't. They prescribed me antidepressants which helped somewhat, but there are still days when I wake up feeling awful. It makes no sense to me; if I'm feeling bad, shouldn't I be taking more pills?\"\nDr. Szozas pauses, sips his coffee, and responds, \"It does make perfect sense, Jillian, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's true. There are many things that are perfectly logical that aren't actually happening that way at all. Sometimes, people who are depressed think that their lives are terrible, that everything sucks, but that isn't always the case. Maybe your life is wonderful, but maybe it feels that way because you are suffering from depression.   Depression is often caused by an imbalance between certain chemicals in the brain -- serotonin, dopamine",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is... is...\" My mind races trying to remember all the names, and I can't seem to recall any more than that, \"...my name is Jenny.\" I realize then that this isn't very useful information, because if I don't know who I am, how will anyone else?\nHe nods encouragingly, \"Jenny, good. Now tell me what brings you to see me today?\"\nWow, this guy knows his stuff! I think to myself. \"Well, um... I've been feeling weird lately, ever since I woke up yesterday morning.\"\n\"How do you feel now?\" he asks gently.\n\"Um... pretty stressed out, maybe anxious, worried, uncertain, confused, scared,\" I reply hesitantly.\n\"And where does that stress come from?\"\nThis question throws me off guard. \"Uh... well, I have no idea.\"\nDr. Szozas chuckles softly, \"No worries, we'll get to that later. Tell me, what brought you here today?\"\nSo I begin telling him about waking up that morning and finding myself in a strange place. The fear that gripped me when I didn't recognize who I was, or even what day it was. All those feelings that had lingered throughout the night, and the next few days after that. And the bizarre dreams that kept coming back. \"That's all there is to say, really,\" I conclude, looking at Dr. Szozas expectantly.\nHe smiles, \"OK, I'm going to ask you some questions, just relax and answer them. Let's start with your age -- how old are you?\"\n\"Oh, uh, well I'm 19 years old, I guess,\" I blurt out without thinking.\n\"Excellent! So that means that you are an adult, yes? You are not under legal guardianship, nor are you a minor, correct?\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Sarah Lantz.\" My eyes shift away momentarily, before returning to meet his gaze. \"And...well...\" I trail off. The silence stretches between us. It feels uncomfortable, awkward, even though we've already had this conversation several times in our email exchange.\nHe breaks the tension by asking, \"So tell me more about what brought you here today?\"\n\"Well, uhm...\" I stammer, \"...my wife left me six months ago. She said she couldn't handle my condition any longer. I can't imagine being married to anyone who wouldn't want to stay with me, especially since I'm so happy all the time. But, there were other reasons too. She just felt that she needed space right now, and didn't think that she'd ever come back.\" I pause again, waiting for him to ask another question, but he doesn't say anything.\nInstead, Dr. Szozas nods thoughtfully, then asks me, \"Have you seen a counselor or therapist previously? Or been diagnosed with a mental illness?\"\n\"No, not really,\" I admit, feeling embarrassed that I have to answer such personal questions. \"Not officially anyway.\"\nDr. Szozas smiles at me reassuringly, and replies, \"OK, well let's get started, shall we?\"\nWe spend about an hour talking about me, and about my life, my marriage, my family -- everything. He asks me about what happened when my husband walked out, about how things are going with my kids, about whether I'm seeing anyone else -- which I am -- about how much sex I'm having -- which I am -- about my job, my hobbies, my interests. He asked me about my dreams, about my hopes, about my fears.\nAs I talk with Dr. Szozas, I realize that I don't know very much about him. He looks to be about 40 years old, but that isn't definite",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is...oh fuck this.\"\nHe smiles broadly again, \"What?\"\n\"It doesn't matter.\" I say dismissively, standing up again and pacing back and forth across the room. My heart pounds in my chest, my palms sweat, and my stomach twists in knots. I have never been more uncomfortable in all my life. I feel like such an idiot.\n\"Well, we can start there...\" He suggests.\n\"OK. It's just that, um, when I went online to find a therapist, they said something about having trouble sleeping. And I do sleep very little. Not even five hours per night, sometimes less than four. But when I wake up, I'm exhausted, and I don't know what to do about it. I've tried meditating, exercising, reading, watching TV -- nothing works. This morning I woke up feeling tired, and then I realized that I didn't want to go to work today because I felt awful, and I couldn't concentrate. And I thought about taking off early, but I had to get my car washed before coming here. So now I'm stuck at home doing nothing.\"\nDr. Szozas nods, and leans forward slightly, his hands clasped together between his knees, \"And how long have you been experiencing these symptoms? For example, if you were to ask me when did the insomnia begin, I would tell you that I believe it began when you were seven years old.\"\nI blink, surprised, \"Seven years old!\" I exclaim.\n\"Yes, that's correct. You started suffering from insomnia at that age. The onset was gradual at first, but after three or four months, you stopped going to bed at all.\"\n\"Oh god,\" I whisper, thinking back to that time. I remember being sad that Mommy wasn't with me. I remember her not telling me that she loved me. I remember crying myself to sleep at night. I",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Amy Jenson.\"\nHe smiles broadly again, \"Amy? That's lovely. And tell me more about yourself, please?\"\nOh god, this guy is good! I feel compelled to talk, and soon enough I find myself telling him all about my life: how my parents divorced when I was young, my dad remarried and moved away, leaving us without much contact, how my mom died when I was 12 years old, how I had trouble fitting in at school, and then the accident...and now I'm stuck living alone with my cat while trying to figure things out. My voice trails off as I realize how personal this conversation is becoming, but Dr. Szozas just sits there smiling at me, nodding along as if what I've said makes perfect sense.\nFinally, after we have talked for quite some time, Dr. Szozas asks me something odd. He looks up at me, \"Do you believe that people can change their lives?\"\nWell, yeah, duh! Of course they can. Why wouldn't they? But I don't say anything; instead, I give him a puzzled look.\nDr. Szozas continues, \"You know, sometimes people come to me with problems that seem impossible to solve. Like alcoholism or drug addiction, or even terminal illnesses. People who are hopelessly locked into bad habits and behaviors that are ruining their lives. How do you explain those situations?\"\nI shrug, \"It's not that simple. Sometimes, when people are really determined to break free, it works out -- but most times, they fail, because there are too many obstacles that get in their way. If only they were willing to try harder, they'd succeed. It's not that complicated, really.\"\nDr. Szozas nods, \"And yet, when you describe your situation, I detect no evidence that you are truly 'locked into' any sort of behavior. You are making an",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Amber.\" I pause for effect, letting him know that I have given this much thought before coming here today. \"And... um...\" My face turns red again. This time though, I feel embarrassed by my reaction. It wasn't all that bad, really.\nHe smiles, and sits back in his chair, waiting patiently for me to continue. He wants to hear what I have to say. He knows that there is something more than meets the eye here.\nAfter clearing my throat, I try to explain myself. \"You see, things started happening last year. At first they were small things, but then they got bigger, and now they've gotten pretty big. I can't seem to control them. Sometimes they happen when I don't want them too, or sometimes I get excited about doing certain things, and suddenly I'm doing those things without even thinking about it. And I just keep going until I end up in trouble. Like earlier tonight. I was just walking home from work, and I saw an old friend. He invited me to go out dancing later, but instead I went somewhere else. I didn't think anything about it at first. But then I found myself standing outside a club, where people are getting drunk and high, having sex right on the sidewalk. They wouldn't stop. I had no choice but to leave because I felt disgusted watching them do that.\n\"Then, I couldn't find my way home. I ended up at a party, but I left after awhile. When I came to, I realized that I'd been wandering around aimlessly, and I finally decided to come here. You see, Dr. Szozas? That's what happened. All these little incidents -- I don't know how to describe them. I don't understand why I did any of that. I just wanted to talk to someone. I hope that I haven't caused you any problems. I really don't want to cause you",
