=== Prompt ========================================
I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.

[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "


=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Jameson, and I've been having problems dealing with my sexuality."
He nods, and responds, "That sounds reasonable, go ahead."
I pause again, trying to decide where to start, but then just blurt out, "Well... I guess the problem started last year, when I was fifteen years old.  ...Oh god, this is embarrassing..."
Dr. Szozas leans forward, and asks, "Tell me about it, please?"
So I tell him, "Well, I was dating a girl, and we were both pretty young. She had recently turned sixteen, and she wanted to experiment sexually. We went to a party at her house one night, and there were a bunch of guys playing beer pong in the basement, and they were all really drunk. Her parents weren't home, and the guys asked if I would join them. I thought it'd be fun, so I did. They took turns hitting the ball into the cups, and I won a few games. Then I saw a guy taking a long swig out of a bottle, and I said, 'Hey, can I have a drink?' and I reached out to grab the bottle. It was a clear glass jug, and I didn't think anything about it, and I lifted the lid, and I gagged. I don't know what happened next; I remember being on the floor, and I'm coughing and spitting, and I heard a voice say, "What the fuck? You got a fucking disease or something?'"
Dr. Szozas listens intently, and I continue, "I tried to get up, and I couldn't. I looked up, and I realized that the room had become dark, and I felt dizzy. When my vision cleared, I found myself in the bathroom, and I was in a stall; I could hear the toilet flushing, and I could smell the stench from the urinal

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Rachelle, I've been seeing a therapist named Michael Szozas about something that's been bothering me." 
He nods, "And what might this 'something' be?" 
"Well..." I begin, then pause. How can I put this? I don't want to get too personal... "I feel depressed sometimes. It just feels like there's nothing to live for anymore, that all I do is work, and go home to sleep, and repeat the cycle. I have a boyfriend, but we never seem to find time together, or really talk about anything important. We fight all the time, and I feel empty inside. Do you think that maybe I should seek counseling?" I ask, hoping for reassurance.
Szozas smiles at me, and shakes his head, "No, I don't believe I can help you. What I can help you with is getting to know you better, and helping you to understand the root cause of your depression. I'd like to meet with you again tomorrow, if possible. Can you come back at 10am?"
I nod, "Yes, I'll be here at ten. I hope I haven't wasted your time, and I appreciate the opportunity. I hope I didn't offend you in any way, I'm not sure what I was thinking, I guess I was worried, I'm not sure if I'm crazy, and I was wondering if I needed help, and I thought I would email you, and I hope I didn't waste your time. I'm sorry for being rude and weird!"
Dr. Szozas chuckles, "I think I need to give you a hug, to show you I'm not offended. I'm a touchy-feely guy, and I'm very good at reading people. You are a lovely young lady, and I promise to answer your questions, and I will try to explain to you the things you are asking

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Emily Mathers. I have been having problems lately, and I don't know where to turn."
He smiles, then nods, "Go ahead, please tell me about what's happening."
I close my eyes, trying to remember all the details, and I start to talk, "It started last week, when I got home from work. My husband was already there, which wasn't unusual, but something was wrong. It felt like we had an argument, but I couldn't recall anything specific that happened. When I asked him, he said nothing was wrong. But I knew better. Something was off. I can never get a straight answer out of him anymore... I think he's hiding things from me. And now, I just feel this sense of dread when I come home..."
Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding along to my words, and his eyes sparkle as I continue, "And I'm afraid to leave the house. Every time I try to go out, I always end up back in the bedroom. I've tried to change jobs, to find new friends, I even went on a date a couple weeks ago, but I keep coming back to the same place. I'm scared. I want to break free, but I'm stuck in the cycle. I need help. I'm not sure what to do, or who I should talk to, or if I should talk to anyone at all. I feel trapped!"
Dr. Szozas looks at me thoughtfully for a moment, and I wait patiently. "I believe I understand your situation, and I'd like to help, if I may. You are experiencing a condition called Dissociative Identity Disorder, or DID. This is a very rare, and complex, mental illness. I'll be honest, I don't fully understand the mechanics, but I can explain the symptoms and effects. 
"In the simplest terms, DID is an

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Rebecca Anne Smith." I pause for a moment, and then continue, "I just want to tell you that I appreciate all that you do for people like myself. You have helped many people, and I know that you would help me too. I don't think I'm crazy, but I also don't understand what is happening to me.   I've been having strange dreams recently, and they seem to be getting worse, or perhaps more intense. They are very vivid, and they aren't normal dreams. My heart races when I wake up from them, and I feel weird afterwards. It feels like there is something wrong with me.
I keep reading this web page, and I find that the most common symptoms include difficulty sleeping, anxiety attacks, panic attacks, trouble breathing, nightmares, fear, and other similar problems. I feel that maybe I should get tested for any illnesses, and if I am sick, I will go back to the doctor for treatment. But I still don't quite trust doctors, and I don't really know how to start finding out if I'm ill.
I've noticed that I sometimes hear voices in my head, although I can't always make out what is being said. Sometimes I hear a voice saying, 'You need to calm down,' or 'It'll be fine.' I don't really know if I'm hearing things or not, or if I'm imagining the whole thing.
I read about lucid dreaming, and I had an idea last night. I thought to myself, "What if I am lucid, and I try to control the dream? Maybe I can figure out what is going on?" I tried to stop the flow of the dream, and I told it to show me the inside of my house. I didn't realize how powerful my own thoughts were, because the dream was suddenly gone. I woke up and felt disoriented.
I'm worried that I may not be able to sleep anymore.

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Amy, and I'm 19 years old."
He nods, "And what brings you here today?"
"Well... I guess I don't know..."
"You have been experiencing certain symptoms which may indicate that you suffer from depression," he states calmly, matter-of-factly, "Do you agree?"
"Yes, sir."
"Are there any other issues which might contribute to this? Any family history, or past traumas, or anything else we should consider?"
"No, nothing really comes to mind."
"So then let's begin by talking about what happened recently; tell me, Amy, what do you remember?"
I feel myself flush slightly, "Um ... I went to school one day, and after class I was walking home, and I had a thought that I needed help, and I looked at the web, and I found a website called 'Help For Depression.' It said that they can help, and I clicked on the link, and I sent an email, and I got an appointment for tomorrow morning at 9am. I think that I need help, and I want to get better. I've tried self-help stuff before, but I just keep thinking that I'm not good enough, that I'll never be able to be happy. I need something more than that. I need to talk to someone, and I'm scared, I don't even know if I'm depressed, I don't know the difference between being sad and feeling bad. I'm not sure if I'm depressed, and I don't know how to find out. I'm afraid of the truth, I'm afraid that I won't be happy again, I'm afraid to ask for help because I'm not sure if the help will work. I'm confused, and I'm worried, and I'm lonely, and I'm tired, and I'm angry, and I'm frustrated, and I'm upset. I

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Mary Jane Watson."   My mother used to call me MJ, and I've been called that ever since I can remember. But lately, I don't know... something just feels off about being called MJ. It doesn't feel right anymore. My real name is Mary Jane Watson, but everyone calls me MJ.
"And why are you here?"  He asks, and I think I hear a hint of disappointment in his tone.
"Um..." I stutter, trying to figure out what to say next. What do I want this guy to understand? This isn't exactly an easy question for me to answer. I need help, but I have no idea where to start. I think back on all the advice I'd gotten online; 'Just tell them the truth.' That's the best way to get through to a shrink, apparently.
I decide to go with the truth, "I'm a superhero!"
Dr. Szozas looks at me, "A hero? Like Superman or Batman or Spiderman?"
I nod, "Yes, sort of. I was born with superpowers; I was given the ability to fly by my parents, I was able to turn invisible, and I was strong enough to lift a car. I was also taught martial arts, gymnastics, and other forms of self-defense, and I was trained in various combat styles. I was even a member of a special forces unit for a while before I became a freelance private detective. And, yes, I am a costumed adventurer known as Supergirl. I was a heroine for a long time, until I discovered that I had powers, and I started using those abilities to protect people. I'm a vigilante now, and I work for the government. I was recently hired to find a missing person, and I found her in a warehouse, and she turned out to be a criminal. I didn't realize at the time; I thought that I

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Adrian Andrews."
He nods, and asks, "And why do you think you're here?"
Well, this is awkward. How can I tell this guy about my problems? My brain feels like it is swimming in molasses, but I try again, "You know, I don't really have a problem. I just want to talk."
Dr. Szozas smiles, and continues to listen attentively, "So what would you say is your issue?"
Oh boy, I thought, now I've got to get something off my chest. This is the part where I usually start talking about all the things that are bothering me. But, I didn't feel any pressure to speak, and my mind went blank. What should I say?
I sat there for a moment, trying to figure out the best way to answer his question. I decided to go with the truth, and hope for the best. "I guess I just wanted to share my thoughts on the future," I said.
Dr. Szozas nodded, "Alright then, let's discuss the future, shall we?"
I took a deep breath, and tried to relax, "OK, I was thinking about the fact that I'm not sure if I will ever find a woman to marry, or even date. I was wondering if I should focus on my career, or if I should find a girlfriend. I was also concerned because I'm not sure if I'll ever meet the right person, and I'm afraid I might never be happy. I'm worried I won't live a fulfilling life. I was hoping to hear some advice from you, doctor."
Dr. Szozas smiled, "That's a lot to cover, and I appreciate the honesty. I'm glad you came by, I'm sure I can help you. So, I need to ask you a few questions, and I'm going to use a technique called 'stream of consciousness

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Andrew James Johnson." I pause briefly to allow myself time to think about what I just said.  I've never been good at lying, but this feels different than usual. My mind wanders back to what I saw online, and then I realize that I don't have to tell him anything more. If he wants to know about my past, then I'll tell him all about it later, after we get started. He nods, encouragingly, and tells me, "Great, now let's start by getting a few things straight. First off, please state your age for the record?" I reply, "Twenty-two years old," and he writes it down.  "Now, I understand that you want to talk about an issue that you feel might be related to sexual identity issues? Is that correct?"
I nod slowly, and say, "Yes, sir, I do. I'm having trouble understanding my sexuality, and I need help figuring out if I am gay or not, and if I am, if I should act on my feelings for other men."
He smiles at me, and says, "OK, I can help you there. Let's go ahead and jump right into the deep end, shall we? Do you masturbate often, and if so, when, where, and how frequently?" I'm taken aback, but I answer honestly, "Yeah, I guess I do. I usually jerk off at least once a day, if not twice. I try to find a quiet place to jack off when I wake up in the morning, and when I come home at night I usually jack off before bed. I also sometimes use the bathroom at work when I'm in a stall, or at lunch, and I even used the washroom in the mall when I was shopping for some clothes last week. I hate doing it in public bathrooms, though, because I always worry somebody will walk in on me while I'm jer

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Andrew Ladd."
He nods, and then asks, "And why have you decided to seek counseling?"
Again, I pause, unsure what to say, but knowing that honesty will always lead to better results, "Well, uh... I've been having trouble sleeping lately, and I think it might be related to this whole 'recovery' thing I've started doing recently."   I lower my head and add, "I don't know if it is recovery or not, but I feel more alive now than before, which scares me because I don't want to lose control again..."
Dr. Szozas smiles gently at me, and responds, "That is understandable. I would suggest we talk about the sleep issues first. Could you tell me a little about the dreams? Are they nightmares, lucid dreams, or something else entirely?"
I nod, "Yeah, I guess that makes sense. I dreamt that I was walking along a beach, and there was all these people in their underwear playing volleyball, and I was trying to find a way in, but I couldn't get through and I was freaking out. I was really scared, and I woke up screaming. And I had a similar experience last night, except I was dreaming that I was being chased by a monster. I was running and hiding, and I was terrified, and the monster was right on my tail. I was able to hide in a closet for a while, and I felt safe, and I thought I was going to die. I just wanted to wake up, I was so afraid!"
I was expecting a smile, and a chuckle, and maybe a pat on the back, and instead I got a very serious expression on his face, "Andrew, I'm sorry to hear that. I can understand the fear. The monsters are real, and the pain is real too. But, I need to ask you a few questions, and I hope you

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is ... My name is ..."
And then I stop myself before I say my real name, because this is a professional setting, and I don't want to get fired or sued or anything.  So instead, I go with something generic, "Jane Doe." And then I continue, "I've been having problems lately, and I think I might need help..."
He nods, and responds, "Why do you think you have problems?"
I pause again, and consider what to tell him. What would a normal person tell their psychiatrist? This is the part where I usually start blabbing about all my troubles, but now I feel awkward telling him my problems, so I keep quiet for a moment, and just stare at him while he stares back.
Then the silence gets uncomfortable, and I try to fill it, "Well, I guess I should explain my problem. I had a boyfriend, and we broke up recently. It was a very messy break-up. We fought a lot, and I tried to end things, and I didn't succeed, and I still care for him a little. I know I shouldn't, I hate him, and I can't stand to even be near him, and I haven't seen him since the breakup, and I'm trying not to contact him, and I'm afraid I will. I'm worried I'll just call, or send a text, and that I won't be able to resist, and I'm not sure if I should. But I really miss him, and I wish I hadn't broken up with him, and I wish I'd never met him. I just, I'm confused, I'm conflicted, and I don't know if I'm being irrational, or I'm crazy, and I'm scared, and I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing. I'm sorry, I'm rambling, I'm nervous, and I hope I wasn't too
