  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Baret Emerald.\" And then I pause again before continuing, \"And... uh...\" I glance nervously at Dr. Szozas.\nHe nods encouragingly, \"You can start by telling me where you live.\"\nThis question makes me uncomfortable. I feel like I've done something wrong. What if he thinks I'm crazy? But I answer, \"Somerset County, Massachusetts.\"\n\"What do you do?\" asks Dr. Szozas, his face serious now.\n\"Well, I work at a bank, actually, but I want to move away from there soon.\"\n\"Where did you go to school?\"\n\"Oh, I went to high school in Massachusetts too, but I transferred after freshman year to a community college nearby. I'm thinking of transferring to another state university this coming semester.\"\nDr. Szozas looks surprised. \"That sounds like quite an accomplishment, considering you were only eighteen when you started college.\"\n\"Yeah, I guess so.\" My mind wanders back to my time at Somerset Community College. It was a good place, but I had to quit because my family moved away from the area, and I couldn't afford the tuition anymore.\n\"So tell me about your life since leaving home,\" prompts the psychiatrist.\nWe talk about the past few months; I explain that I met a girl named Morgan at a party, and we became friends, and I'd been seeing her for a while. I also mention that she broke up with me, but I'm still hung up on her. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm confused. I'm depressed. I'm angry. I'm sad. I'm horny. I'm scared. I'm confused. I'm frustrated. I'm anxious. I'm horny. I'm confused. I'm lonely. I'm horny. I'm confused. I'm sad. I'm horny. I'm confused. I'm horny",

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

I feel myself slipping away, losing control. The thought of suicide crosses my mind, and it scares me more than anything else. If this doctor can help me, maybe I'll have a chance. Maybe there's something wrong with me, and I don't even know it yet. My heart races, I shake, and I sweat profusely. It feels like I've just run five miles uphill.\n\"Barrett, please tell me exactly why you're here today? What do you want to talk about?\" He prompts gently.\n\"Well...\" I begin slowly, trying to find words to describe the feeling inside me. \"I'm not sure what to call it, but I seem to be having trouble with controlling my emotions. I get angry easily, and I lose track of reality. When I go outside, I keep thinking about things that aren't real, or I might start crying uncontrollably if I'm left alone too long. Sometimes I can't remember where I am for a while after I leave a place. I guess I'm a little lost sometimes, I need help to figure out who I am. And I'm scared to be by myself all the time.\" I stop talking and look at the ground; I don't really understand any of that. I wish I had a friend to share it with, but I have none. I look back up at Dr. Szozas' face, and I wait to hear his reply.\nThe psychiatrist sits quietly, absorbing my story. \"Tell me about the first incident that brought you here,\" he directs.\n\"It was about two weeks ago when I was at the mall with my sister, we were going to the food court when I saw her boyfriend with another girl",

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Baret Emeraldia.\"\nHe nods thoughtfully, \"And why have you chosen this particular name?\"\nI pause again, wondering how much information should be given to this stranger? And then I decide, \"Well, since I don't know where else to go, I guess I'll tell you what happened. First off, I think maybe I'm bipolar, or something similar. The last few weeks have been very hard for me. I've had trouble sleeping, and I can't seem to keep myself focused. I also feel depressed most of the time, and I have trouble concentrating. I'm just not sure if there's anything wrong with me or not. It might help if I knew more about...well...\"\nDr. Szozas leans forward, \"It sounds to me like you may be experiencing symptoms of clinical depression. This is quite common in young people today. Have you ever considered talking to a therapist about this?\"\nI nod slowly, \"Yeah, I'm thinking about seeing one soon. But before I do that, I wanted to ask you about something else. I saw a website called 'Huffington Post', and they said that you specialize in unusual cases. Is this true?\"\nDr. Szozas smiles at me, and then his face grows serious, \"Yes, I am indeed well-known for helping those with mental disorders such as yours.\"\nI smile back at him, relieved that I wasn't crazy after all. I look at him expectantly.\n\"Tell me about the events that led up to your current state, and about the problems that you are currently having.\"\nSo I start to talk about the things that I remember happening, the oddities that I experienced, and the strange feelings that I am now feeling. I describe the dreams that I am having, the nightmares that I am having, the way that I am acting out the daydreams that I am having. I confess that I",

It feels like I'm dreaming, but when I try to remember them, nothing comes to mind.\"\nDr. Szozas pauses, \"Hmm. Do you know if anyone else has had similar experiences? Perhaps you might share those memories with us, when you get a chance.\"\nSo I tell him about the dream I had last night where I was a pirate captain, and how I'd heard about a treasure chest that held an ancient artifact called the Eye of Ra.
