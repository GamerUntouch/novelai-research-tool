He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books.

Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",

Would you care to explain more about those issues? You can start by telling me about your sleep patterns, any difficulties you've had getting to sleep or staying asleep.   Any nightmares? Nightmares are usually a symptom of underlying anxiety, fear, or stress. Do you wake up feeling anxious, tense, fearful, or stressed before bedtime?\"\nI sigh, and tell him, \"Yeah, I guess I do feel a little anxious sometimes. I'm not sure if I should talk about this, but I really want to get better. I just really need to sleep properly, and I need to stop being afraid of my dreams.\"\nDr. Szozas listens intently, and after a moment responds, \"OK, let's discuss the dream. What were the details of the nightmare? Can you recall the images, the emotions you felt, the sensations in your body when the nightmare occurred?\"\nI try to remember, but I really can't, I must have blocked the memory away.

  "prompt": "I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",
  "result": "My name is Elizabeth Bronski.\"\nHe smiles again, and asks, \"And why have you chosen to seek professional counseling?\"\n\"Well...it started one night after work...\"\nI tell him about my encounter with Mr. Jones, and my subsequent email exchange with him. As I do, I feel myself relax, and I realize I've been holding my breath. I exhale slowly, letting out all the air I'd been using to keep my anxiety at bay.\nDr. Szozas listens intently, nodding occasionally while I talk. When I finish telling the story, he nods once more, then responds, \"That sounds very similar to what happened to me several years ago. I had a very similar experience, except that I was not quite as fortunate as you were.   I was dating a woman named Samantha, whom I met online, and we were both single professionals. We became friends, and eventually she invited me out on a date. I went along, and when I arrived at her place, I found the door unlocked. She wasn't home. I waited for a few minutes, and when I couldn't hear anything, I decided to leave a note. I wrote a brief message, and left it on the kitchen counter. I thought I would return later.\nI did, and I knocked on the door. No answer. I tried the door, and found it locked. I walked away, figuring I would come back another time. I returned a couple days later, and the door still remained closed. I didn't want to disturb her, and I figured I might try knocking on the door a third or fourth time, but I never got the chance.\nI heard a scream, and I ran to the door, and there I saw the most horrific scene. Her boyfriend, a guy I knew to be an asshole named Robert, had broken into the apartment. He held a knife to her throat, and he threatened me.",
