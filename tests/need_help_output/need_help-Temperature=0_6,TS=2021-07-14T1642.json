Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Lisa.\"\nHe nods, smiles again, and asks, \"And why are you here?\"\nWow, this guy is good! This is exactly what I need. I feel relaxed already...and relieved too, because now there's something tangible to do: answer questions. \"Well, um, I think I have an anxiety disorder...\"\n\"Oh? What sort of anxiety does that entail?\" he inquires kindly.\n\"It's hard to explain, but basically I just don't know what to do or where to turn,\" I admit, and I realize after saying it that perhaps it wasn't such a great idea. But Dr. Szozas doesn't seem upset by it, and continues to listen attentively.\n\"OK, let's start with an overview of what we can expect when we get started today,\" he says, and he turns his attention back to his computer screen. He types a few words, then looks up at me, \"Tell me about your childhood.\"\nSo far, so good! Maybe he won't be too bad. I try to give him all the details I remember about growing up, but sometimes I'm not sure if I've answered correctly or left out important bits. After awhile, I begin to wonder how much time he actually needs, and I ask him, \"Are you done yet?\"\nHe shakes his head slowly, sadly, \"No, Lisa, I need to hear more. Tell me the whole story from the beginning.\"\nWow, this guy is really good! And nice! I tell him everything that happened since I first met Mrs. K, and I am surprised at myself that I am able to relate it so well. When I finish, Dr. Szozas is silent, but his expression is sympathetic, concerned. I'm hoping that I haven't screwed anything up, but he clears his throat, \"You said that you had some problems with other people at school, right?\"\n",
