  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Jennifer Harris.\"\nHe nods, and asks again, \"And why have you sought this appointment?\"\nSo I tell him about the incident where I had become obsessed with finding the lost city of Troy, and then went insane. When I finish telling him, he looks at me, \"Jennifer, do you know what schizophrenia is? It's not uncommon amongst people that suffer from mental illness. And sometimes they can get better by taking medication. Do you think there might be something wrong with you mentally?\"\n\"Well, yes. But I don't want to go through any tests or anything. I just need help right now. Please,\" I say, and I find myself tearing up a little. I'm not sure if it is because I've been diagnosed with having a mental disorder, but I feel weak inside, and I begin to cry.\nDr. Szozas stands up and moves closer to me. His arms wrap around me, and he pulls me into a comforting hug. My tears subside somewhat, and I try to smile up at him. \"It'll be alright, honey,\" he whispers softly into my ear. I nod against his shoulder, and I squeeze back. He continues to hold me, and I relax a bit more. The moment passes, and we both let out a sigh at the same time.\nI pull away, wipe a tear off my cheek with the sleeve of my blouse, and look at him with a new resolve. I stand up, and I walk to his desk to pick up a folder that is sitting next to a computer monitor. I return to the sofa, and I open the file, which contains a few pages of notes. I read them, and I realize that Dr. Szozas has already seen me.\n\"What is your diagnosis?\" I ask, but I am nervous about the answer.\n\"Schizophrenia,\" he responds, and I hear the word come out with a hint",

    " working for a drug cartel in Mexico. The killers took all our cash, passports, credit cards, and even Jack's laptop computer with all the research I'd done online. Now I don't know",
    " what to do next. I want to find out more about myself before I go anywhere else.\"\nThe psychiatrist leans forward, and asks, \"Why did you decide to come to see me today?\"",
    "\nI sigh deeply, \"Because I think I might be crazy. I've been having dreams, strange nightmares that keep me up at night. And I'm not sure if I'm really sane or",

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Lara Croft.\"  Then I continue, \"And this isn't just any old visit to a doctor, this is an urgent one.\"  Dr. Szozas looks puzzled by my comment, and then he smiles broadly again, \"Well, let's get started, shall we?\"\nHe stands up from his chair and leads me to another room where there is a small table and two chairs. He seats himself in one of them, while I remain standing.\n\"Now, tell me what brings you here today, please?\"  He asks politely, and I do too, \"I've been feeling really weird lately, and I can't seem to find anyone else who understands what I'm talking about. The internet doesn't help much either. I was hoping that you might have insight into what is happening to me.\"\nDr. Szozas listens intently to all that I say, nodding his head periodically. He leans forward in his chair and puts his hands together, elbows resting atop his knees, \"OK, now I want to ask you questions about what's happening with you, and I'll need you to answer truthfully. Is that understood?\"\n\"Yes sir,\" I reply.\n\"What is your age?\" he inquires.\n\"Thirty-five years old,\" I inform him.\n\"Are you married? Have children? Do they live with you?\"\n\"No sir,\" I respond to each question.\n\"Have you ever had a psychiatric or psychological problem before?\"\n\"Not that I know of,\" I admit honestly.\n\"Do you currently use illegal drugs or alcohol?\"\n\"No sir,\" I state firmly.\n\"Any other addictions, such as gambling, sex addiction, compulsive shopping, or workaholism?\"\n\"No sir, I don't think so,\" I reply.\n\"You said that the web didn't help you.

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Lara Croft.\"\nHe nods slowly, almost imperceptibly, then looks away.\n\"Lara, do you have any idea what's happening to you?\" he asks gently, and I shake my head. \"You don't know? You've been having nightmares, waking up screaming in the middle of the night, sometimes vomiting blood... Do you recall anything else?\"\nAgain I shake my head negatively. He sits back in his chair, folds his hands across his lap, and leans forward slightly. \"Do you remember being born?\" he asks softly. Again I shake my head, and he continues, \"What year were you born?\" again I shake my head. He pauses, and smiles, \"Have you ever seen a doctor before?\" I nod. \"When was the last time?\" I shrug, \"Never mind. What did they tell you when you saw them?\"\nI think about this question, trying to figure out where he's going with this line of questioning. It feels like he wants to get a feel for my state of mind, which makes sense since I'm seeing a psychiatrist. \"They said that I had epilepsy, or something like that...\"\nDr. Szozas grins broadly, and stands up, and begins walking about the room, pacing while he speaks, \"Yes, yes, that sounds right. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that affects the brain, causing seizures.\"\nI stand up to follow him, but he stops suddenly, turns to face me, and asks, \"How long ago was the first seizure?\"\nI pause, thinking about the answer, and I realize that I don't really know the answer to that question. I finally say, \"Well, I was five years old I guess, I was playing with a friend, we fell off a swing set at the playground, I hit the ground hard and blacked-out. I woke up to find that I was laying on the grass",
