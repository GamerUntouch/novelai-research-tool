So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him.

One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

When I finish talking, he sits back in his chair, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.\n\"Well, that certainly sounds... interesting...\" he murmurs. \"You say that you haven't had any problems before?\"\nI nod vigorously, \"No sir, not until today. I'm not sure if there is something wrong with me or not, but I can't stop thinking about it. It's driving me crazy!\"\n\"Hmm. Well, let's start by getting a sense of where things stand right now.

He asks more questions along the way, and when I'm done, he leans forward, elbows resting on his knees, hands clasped together, \"That was very helpful, thank you. I'll need to ask a few follow-up questions to get a better idea of the situation. For instance, I'd like to know how long you played SAO prior to logging out today.

His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is...Kirito.\"\nHe nods once, then asks, \"How old are you?\"\n\"...Twenty-one years old.\"\n\"And where do you live now?\"\n\"In Aincrad.\"\n\"Aha...\" The doctor taps his chin thoughtfully. \"What would you say is your occupation? You don't have any visible profession listed in the web browser, do you?\"\n\"No, none.\"\n\"Hmm...so what brings you to see me today, Kirito?\"\n\"Well, um...my body won't stop moving sometimes. Like when I wake up in the morning or after I go to sleep at night. And there aren't any obvious triggers, either. It just happens, without warning. I can feel it happening, but I have no idea why.\"\nDr. Szozas' face goes blank for a moment, then he smiles again, \"That sounds quite normal to me. Have you ever experienced this before?\"\n\"Uh...no, never.\"\n\"So you haven't had any problems with sleeping lately?\"\n\"Not really. I've been getting eight hours a day, normally.\"\nThe psychiatrist nods. \"You said you were twenty-one when we began our conversation. What year is it right now?\"\n\"Um...it's June 22nd, 2022.\"\n\"June. That means it's the summer solstice. So when did you begin experiencing these symptoms?\"\nI think back to the date I logged into SAO the first time: August 1st, 2026. I wasn't sure if the game was still running at that point, but I figured that the real world was probably the same. So I responded, \"August. I believe that was when I started having the problem.\"\nSzozas nodded, \"Very good. So let me ask one more question. When was the last time you played the MMO World Seed Online?\"\n\"",
