Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

I don't know what happened after I left home. All I remember is waking up naked in this room, confused and disoriented. There are other memories too, but they aren't important right now. What matters is that I need help, and I need it fast.\n\"What do you want to talk about?\" Dr. Szozas asks gently, encouragingly. He doesn't rush me, or try to force anything onto me, just calmly waiting for me to decide whether I should continue. I feel myself relax, and begin to open up to him.\nI start by telling him about my parents, which is easy enough since we've already established that I live alone. It wasn't until I was sixteen that I learned about their death. They were killed in a car accident when I was fourteen, and the police never found out who did it, though they suspect that my father had an affair with another woman. I didn't learn any details about her, but she apparently got pregnant and the baby died in childbirth. I also learned that my mother had been having affairs before that one, and that I might not be the only child that resulted from those relationships. I was angry at them for cheating on each other with others, but I still loved them dearly; I knew that if I'd known about the first pregnancy I would not have let them go through with the abortion.\nDr. Szozas listens intently to everything I said, nodding occasionally as I spoke. I can't really describe the feeling I get from talking to him; I'm used to being the center of attention, but I feel at ease with Dr. Szozas listening to me without interrupting. I feel like I'm opening up to him, I trust",
