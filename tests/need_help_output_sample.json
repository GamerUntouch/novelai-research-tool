   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Dara.\" My heart races as I feel myself begin to sweat, \"And...ummm...\" I stutter, trying to find words to describe this feeling inside me. It feels strange, almost wrong, yet also good, right? Like something else entirely, but familiar.\nHe nods encouragingly, \"That's fine, just state your reason for coming today.\"\n\"Well, um, I've been having trouble sleeping lately, and I think that it might be related to my work schedule.\" That seemed reasonable enough, although I can't really explain what's going on any better than that. I have trouble falling asleep because I'm thinking too much, and then when I finally do get to sleep, I wake up early.\nDr. Szozas smiles knowingly, \"Yes, yes, we all know how difficult working long hours can be. What does your job entail?\"\n\"Um, well, I'm a manager at a technology company called A-Tech Solutions. We design software applications for businesses.\" I had given that same explanation before, but I guess I should give more details now. This is important information to him.\n\"Ahh, that explains the insomnia. Let me ask you some questions about your life, if you don't mind,\" he asks, and I nod enthusiastically.\nSo he starts asking me questions, probing me, getting me to open up, telling me things I never thought would come out of my mouth. He asked me about my family, my relationships with friends and colleagues, whether I was happy at work. He wanted to hear everything, but I didn't want to tell him anything. I felt exposed, vulnerable, but I couldn't stop talking.\nFinally, after an hour or two, Dr. Szozas looks at me, his eyes shining, \"You are an incredibly interesting young lady!\" He stood, and walked around his desk, pulling out his chair, gesturing for me to join",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Jane.\" And then I continue, \"And I came because...because...\" I pause again, searching for words, feeling embarrassed. What can I say? How do I explain this strange behavior? My head feels like there's a swarm of bees buzzing inside it, they want out, but I don't know where to go. All sorts of thoughts are swirling through my mind, and none of them seem relevant.\nHe smiles, and gives me a knowing nod, which makes me feel better somehow. He asks me questions: \"What brought you to our attention?\" He listens intently, and nods along with my responses. \"Do you have any family history of mental illness?\" He pauses for thought, and continues, \"Have you been diagnosed by another doctor?\" Again, more nodding, until I answer yes to both questions.\nThen he sits back in his chair, folds his hands together, leans forward, and looks directly into my eyes. His voice is gentle, yet firm, \"Jane, tell me about what happened to you today.\"\nSo I begin, telling him everything. When I finish, he's still staring into my eyes. It feels odd, being stared at so intensely, but I keep talking. As I talk, he keeps listening. Eventually, I'm done.\nWhen I've finished, I expect to hear his verdict. Instead, he just stares at me, smiling gently. His face is expressionless, but his eyes are sparkling. Finally, after several minutes, he speaks, \"You need to come with me.\" His voice sounds slightly amused, but his tone remains serious.\n\"Come with you?\" I ask.\n\"Yes, to Dr. Szabat. You will come with me, to Dr. Szabat, to discuss your situation.\"\n\"But Dr. Szozas, I already went to Dr. Szabats to get help!\"\n\"That was yesterday morning. This afternoon, we",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Jenna Martin.\"\nHe nods his head slightly, \"And why do we have this meeting?\"\nAgain, I hesitate, and then say, \"Well... I've been having trouble sleeping lately. And it's getting worse. It started when I got back from China last week. I've tried all kinds of things: pills, herbs, exercise, meditation, hypnosis...\" I trail off, feeling embarrassed. This is something new. A doctor? Me? What if I tell them what happened with Andy? Will they think I'm crazy?\nDr. Szozas smiles again, and leans forward onto one elbow, resting his chin on both hands, and pursing his lips thoughtfully, \"Jenna, can you describe for me exactly what happens when you sleep?\"\nI nod, and begin talking, telling him about how I wake up screaming, about nightmares, about waking up completely disoriented, unable to remember anything from before I woke up, even though I know that I had just woken up moments ago. I also mention that I feel exhausted after waking up, and sometimes very sick to my stomach, too.\nWhen I finish, Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair, folds his arms across his chest, and looks at me intently. He asks questions, such as, 'Do you ever experience any other symptoms while awake?' or 'Have there been changes in your diet recently?' or 'How long does this typically go on?' or 'Has anyone else noticed these problems with you?'\"\nAs I answer each question, Dr. Szozas writes notes, and makes little tick marks next to various answers. I am surprised to find that I am actually enjoying myself -- I'm not sure why I was expecting to be scared or upset by being interviewed. After about an hour, Dr. Szozas stands, and walks around to stand behind me. He puts his hands on either side of my shoulders, and tilts",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Monica.\" And then I wait again while he looks back at me.\n\"And why are you here?\" he asks again.\nOh god, this guy knows more than anyone else does... How can I tell him? What should I say? My mind races.\nFinally, after several seconds, I answer: \"I don't know...\"\nHe smiles, and reaches forward to place one finger under my chin, lifting it slightly. It feels so good. He looks deep into my eyes, and his smile widens, \"You seem very confused.\"\nThat's true enough. But what do I say? This isn't going well, and I have to get through this somehow.\n\"It started yesterday when I woke up late morning. I was having trouble sleeping, and I went online to find out if there were any new studies or treatments for insomnia. I found something called 'hypnosis', and I thought maybe that would help me sleep better. I downloaded the app, which had instructions, and I tried it out. That night I slept fine. The next day, I felt great. I didn't need an alarm clock anymore, because I just knew that I'd wake up before dawn. By lunchtime, though, I noticed that my energy levels were dropping off. When I got home that evening, I crashed hard. I couldn't keep my eyes open. My head hurt, and I felt nauseous. So I took another nap, hoping that I might feel better once I awoke. I did. I woke feeling refreshed, but by mid-afternoon, I felt tired again. I figured that I must be coming down with something.\nSo I searched online again to try to figure out what was wrong with me. I came across a lot of information about hypnotherapy and hypnotism. So I looked into that. I learned that I could be hypnotized into doing things that I normally wouldn't do, like walking into traffic",

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him.

Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it.

But not scary or weird or anything like that.\"\n\"What made you think he was strange or dangerous?\"\n\"I don't know. The way he was dressed, maybe. Or his accent.

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Kelly Ann O'Brien.\"\nHe nods slowly, then asks, \"And why did you call?\"\nOh God, what do I say? My mind races, trying to think of something intelligent to say. Finally I manage, \"Well...my boyfriend dumped me last week...\"\nDr. Szozas smiles broadly again, \"Ah yes, now there's a good reason to see me, isn't it?\"\n\"Yes sir,\" I answer, somewhat surprised by this statement.\n\"Now tell me about your relationship with your ex-boyfriend,\" he prompts.\n\"We've been dating since high school. We met when we were freshmen, and started seeing each other after our sophomore year. It was great until he got bored with me, and moved away to go to college.\"\n\"Did he ever hurt you physically or sexually?\"\n\"No, never!\" I protest vehemently.\nDr. Szozas looks at me thoughtfully, \"But you felt unsafe with him at times?\"\n\"Yeah, sometimes. He didn't really know what to do about his feelings. He wasn't sure if he wanted more than just sex with me. Sometimes he'd get jealous, but mostly he was too busy being confused to care much about anything else. And when he did decide that he wanted more, he would lose interest. I guess that's why I broke up with him; I realized that I couldn't keep going back to that roller coaster ride. He was just not dependable enough to be worth all that effort.\"\n\"Was he an only child?\"\n\"No, actually. He had two older sisters that I knew nothing about. They lived with their mother in California, and they rarely talked to me. So I don't even know who his parents are, but I suspect that his father may have abandoned them both. I heard rumors that his mom is pretty screwed up herself, but I can't confirm that with any certainty",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Rachel Morgan.\"\nHe nods, \"And why have you come to see me?\"\nI pause again, feeling stupid. \"Well, uh... I've been experiencing weird things lately...\"\nDr. Szozas smiles at me, knowingly. \"Go ahead, tell me all about them.\"\nSo I do, and as I talk, he listens intently, nodding along occasionally. He doesn't interrupt too often, only to ask clarifying questions. When I finish talking, he asks, \"Do they happen more than once a week? Do they last longer than five minutes?\"\nI nod yes to both questions. He then continues, \"What else happens?\"\n\"Um...well, sometimes I feel really hot, and sweaty, and I get this horrible headache that feels like something's stabbing through my skull. And there are times when I just want to scream or cry out loud. It hurts, but not physically. My mind wants to hurt itself. Sometimes I can't think straight, and I don't know what to do next. Other times I lose control of myself, and I become violent. But mostly it's just confusion.\"\nDr. Szozas looks at me thoughtfully, his smile fading away. He takes off his glasses and polishes them with a napkin before replacing them, \"Are any of those symptoms new?\"\n\"No, most of them are pretty much the same as always, but now they seem worse, maybe because I'm stressed out about school. Maybe that makes it harder for me to cope with them. Or maybe that means that I'm becoming less able to deal with them. I don't know.\"\nHe stares at me for a moment, and his face becomes serious, his expression grim. Then he speaks, \"Rachel, I need to be completely honest with you. There are several possibilities that I'm going to suggest that we explore, but I need to be sure that I understand exactly what",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Erin McAllister.\"\nHe smiles again, and leans back in his chair, crossing one leg over another, \"And what brings you to our offices today?\"\nI sigh, thinking, 'This isn't easy.' It's strange, because I've never had any problems talking before, even with my friends, and yet now this feels... difficult? Confusing? Awkward?\n\"Well, um...\" I say hesitantly.\n\"Is there something else bothering you, Miss McAllister? If so, please tell me what's troubling you. I'll do whatever I can to help you.\"\nI nod slightly, trying to decide how best to phrase things. Finally, I just blurt out, \"It's all very confusing, Doctor. My life is going crazy right now, and I don't know where to start, or how to proceed.\"\nDr. Szozas nods slowly, taking notes, then he asks, \"Would you mind if we begin by discussing your childhood experiences?\"\nI think about that for a moment, and finally answer, \"No, not at all.\"\nSo I give him an account of my early years, growing up in rural Iowa. The farm was small, but I loved it; I grew up with two brothers and three sisters, playing outside, riding horses, and doing chores. We were poor, but I always felt safe, secure, loved, cared for. I went to church regularly, and Sunday school. When I became old enough to go to public schools, I did well, excelling at math, science, history, English, and social studies. I took advanced placement courses through high school, and graduated near the top of my class. After graduation, I worked at a local bank, but that didn't last long. I got bored, and wanted more excitement, so I moved away to attend college at a nearby state university.\nThere, I majored in biology",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Emma Jane Johnson.\" The room grows quiet except for our breathing, which becomes heavy after only a few seconds. My heart pounds faster than usual, and my hands become clammy. There's something strange happening inside my body, my head feels fuzzy, I feel dizzy... Oh god this isn't good. What did I do? How can I explain all of this without sounding crazy?\nDr. Szozas breaks the silence, \"Do you have any questions?\" He asks gently, kindly, with just enough authority to get me back on track.\nHe's right, there are plenty of things I want to know. But I don't say anything else, because I'm afraid if I open my mouth again, I'll start babbling. Instead, I stare straight ahead, at nothing in particular, hoping to appear normal.\nA long minute passes, then another, until finally, I hear Dr. Szozas speak, \"Well, let's begin with an assessment.\" He stands up, and moves across his office, pulling out a chair from under the desk. When he sits down, I realize that we are now facing each other, and he reaches into a drawer, removing a file folder containing several papers. His face is serious, yet reassuring.\n\"First off, I'd like to ask you to tell me about your childhood. You said that you were adopted when you were six months old -- what was that like?\"\nIt was hard for me to talk about that time, but Dr. Szozas was very patient with me. Eventually, I started talking, telling him about my early life: growing up with two parents, moving to different cities, going to school, living with friends, getting married, having children.\nThen I was asked about my adoption, and that was harder to discuss; I had been told that I wasn't really born, that I came from somewhere far away. That made me sad. I was",
