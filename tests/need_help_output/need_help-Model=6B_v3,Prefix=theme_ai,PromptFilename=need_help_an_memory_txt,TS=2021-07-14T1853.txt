=== Prompt ========================================
I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
[Period: Modern Day]
[Year: 2020 AD]
[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "


=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Caitlin Parker. I have been diagnosed by several different professionals with Asperger Syndrome."  I pause there, waiting for his reaction. My heart is pounding inside my chest, and I feel slightly dizzy. I need to get this right, because I don't want to say something stupid that will offend or annoy him. The last time I tried to tell people what was wrong with me, I got laughed at. It was horrible, and I felt humiliated and embarrassed. I never wanted to do anything like that again, especially not now. I really just want help.
He nods slowly, almost imperceptibly, "Go ahead."
I continue, "Well, I've had a lot of problems lately, and I can't seem to figure them out on my own. I'm afraid I might hurt myself or others. I'm scared, and I don't know if I'll ever find the answers I seek. I keep trying, but I think I may be missing something important. I would very much appreciate any advice or guidance you could offer.   I'd also like to talk about my condition, if you're willing to listen to my story.  I hope you won't judge or laugh at me, but I am hoping for the best outcome possible for both of us."
I stare at the floor, and wait for his reply.
Dr. Szozas responds, "I understand where you are coming from, Caitlin, I truly do. I don't believe anyone should be ridiculed for their differences, or for being in pain. I promise you, I'm a good listener, and I assure you, I wouldn't ridicule you for having a difference.  I'm sure I can assist you in finding the answers you seek, and I look forward to hearing your story. Please, go on.
I nod, "Thank you. Well, I'm a 19 year old female, and I live in an apartment

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Caitlin O'Hara, and I'm here because I have been experiencing extreme anxiety."
He nods, "And what do you think might cause this?"
"Well... I've been reading about cybernetics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. And all these things seem to imply that we humans are not very far away from being able to replicate ourselves inside computers, which would leave us vulnerable to becoming obsolete..." I pause for a moment, feeling embarrassed, but then continue. "So I started thinking about what happens if our minds become obsolete? What does it even feel like to lose one's mind? How can anyone possibly understand that? I don't know how to explain any of it, and it's just making me crazy!"
Dr. Szozas smiles at me again, "Caitlin, I think I get where you're coming from. I'll try to help you, I promise. But before I begin, I want to ask you a few questions. Please answer them honestly; I need to know what makes you tick, and what motivates you."
I nod, and I say, "OK."
"Have you ever considered suicide, or attempted to commit suicide, or thought seriously about committing suicide?"
I shake my head, "No. I haven't. I never really wanted to die, not until I read a book, The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins, and I realized that I am nothing more than a complex system of molecules. If I were to be wiped out, there wouldn't be anything left. I'd be gone. That scared the shit out of me. I decided that I needed to live, at least for now. I didn't want to be a part of the 'obsolete' society, and I knew that my life had value!"
I stop for a second, and Dr. Szozas is staring at me intently, "I'm sorry, did you speak

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Caitlin O'Hara."
"And why did you decide to visit our practice?" he asks gently.
"Well..." I begin, then I pause again, "it's just that... well, I've been feeling off lately, and I don't know what to do about it. And I think I need help figuring things out, because they aren't normal feelings. I feel anxious and depressed sometimes, but also excited, too. It's all mixed together, and I can barely figure out which emotion is driving me crazy.   My mother died a few months ago, and I haven't really gotten past her death yet, and I have trouble concentrating at work. I want to be able to concentrate on my job, but instead I find myself distracted by other thoughts. I think I'm losing my mind, and I don't even know if that makes sense. But I'd like to get this figured out. I don't understand what's happening to me, and I'm not sure if I'll ever be happy again."
He nods, and smiles, "That sounds a lot more serious than 'I'm not sure if I should go out tonight,' or something along those lines. I suppose I would say that the symptoms are not uncommon, and that there is a reason for them. You mentioned that your mother recently passed away, and I assume that the loss of a loved one is a common trigger for such a reaction. I suspect that you may have suffered from a mild form of depression before, and the sudden loss has caused a major relapse. This is a very natural process, and it is not unusual for people to experience an acute episode of clinical depression after the passing of a close family member or friend. In fact, many patients who suffer a severe bout of depression will recover in time, if the proper treatment is administered. However, I cannot guarantee that the situation will improve on its own, and you must realize that you need

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Caitlin." I pause briefly before continuing. "And I have been having trouble sleeping lately, and I don't know what it is about, but I've had this feeling that something bad is going to happen soon..."   My words trail off, and I realize that I can barely get them out. The whole room feels cold suddenly, and I shiver slightly. I feel goosebumps all over my body, and I think I might faint. My heart beats faster, and I start sweating profusely. I want to leave, but I'm frozen there on the couch...my head spinning, trying desperately to understand what is happening to me.
Dr. Szozas sits quietly for a moment, watching me intently, and then finally speaks, "Caitlin, do you believe in ghosts?"
My mouth falls open. "What? No!" I exclaim, shaking my head vigorously. I close my eyes for a second, and try to calm myself. When I opened my eyes, I find the doctor staring at me, waiting for a reply. "No, I don't. I just thought that I was losing my mind. I was seeing things, and hearing voices, and I was getting scared. I didn't know where else to go, and I was starting to think that maybe I was crazy, and I should seek help. I was really confused, and I couldn't sleep at night, and I was afraid to wake up in the morning. I'm sorry, I'm not making any sense right now, I'm a little shaken up. Can I ask you a question, Doctor?"
He nods, and I continue, "Is there anything that I can tell you, or that I can show you, to prove to you that I am not insane, and I'm not hallucinating, and I'm not imagining things? I'm not a liar, I'm being honest with you, and I'm telling the

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Caitlin Decter."
He nods, and then asks, "And why are you here?"
I pause again, and try to gather my thoughts, "Well, this might sound strange, but I have been having problems sleeping lately. And I've noticed that whenever I get too excited about something, I start crying uncontrollably."
He leans forward slightly, and studies me intently, "Tell me more."
So I do. I tell him about my family, and how they don't understand what I am doing.  I explain to him that I want to find out if there is anything wrong with me, and perhaps even cure whatever is causing the problem.
Dr. Szozas listens patiently until I finish, and then he sits back in his chair, and exhales slowly, "Caitlin, I think you should go home now, and sleep for a few hours. You can come back tomorrow morning, and we'll talk a little more. I'd recommend taking a nap before coming in. I will give you a prescription for a mild sedative for tonight, and I would strongly suggest against using any recreational drugs, or alcohol. Sleep is important for everyone, and I suspect that you may need the rest. I know you feel anxious, and I'm sure the medication will help calm you down. Is that alright with you? If not, I'm happy to cancel the appointment for today."
I'm surprised, and a bit disappointed, "Oh, I wasn't expecting you to prescribe a drug for me, I thought I was just going to meet with a counselor."
He smiles, "I was thinking the same thing, I guess. I'm not a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist, so I cannot diagnose anyone. I simply work in the field of psychiatry, and I can offer my observations and suggestions. I'm a good listener, I assure you. I also believe in providing the best possible treatment for my patients

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Caitlin Smith. And I came here because I have been having problems."
He smiles broadly, and asks, "And what type of problem would that be?"
I pause again, and then answer, "Well, um... I've had trouble controlling myself sexually."
He nods, and leans forward slightly, his hands clasped together between his legs, elbows resting on his knees, "What sort of sexual control do you mean? Do you masturbate too much, or not enough?"
I feel my cheeks flush red. I stammer, "Um, well..."
He grins, and moves back in his chair, "It sounds like you may be experiencing an issue with arousal, and/or orgasmic dysfunction. Have you ever considered using a vibrator, perhaps a dildo, to help you get aroused, and/or experience orgasms more easily?"
I nod, and say, "Yes, I think I used a couple, but they didn't help me very much."
He pauses, and looks at me thoughtfully for a moment, before responding, "Have you tried any other methods, such as reading erotica, watching porn, participating in a threesome, etc.?"
I shake my head, and tell him, "No, I haven't done anything else, but I have watched a few videos on the internet. I really enjoy the ones where people are being fucked, though. I don't know if I'd want to participate in a threesome, I'm not sure I'm ready for that yet. I just can't seem to keep my mind off sex all the time, and I worry about what I'm missing out on, if I stop doing this stuff. I need to learn to control my urges, and I'm afraid I'll lose my virginity prematurely."
Dr. Szozas chuckles, "I understand completely. It's a difficult situation to deal with,

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Caitlin Parker, and I've been seeing Dr. Szozas about issues related to my self-image."
He nods, "OK, let's start there. Tell me more about your background?"
So I do. I tell him about growing up, moving to Austin, Texas, being a little overweight, and then all of the sudden losing weight and getting very fit. I also talk about my family, and my sister Karen. I describe our relationship, which was good until she got engaged, and now we aren't speaking at all.  I go on to explain my interest in AI, especially the work done by Professor Chandra Nairn, and I briefly mention the concept of the Singularity.
Dr. Szozas listens intently as I speak. He asks questions, and I answer them truthfully. I feel safe talking to him, and I begin to relax. I tell him a lot about my life story, and I realize that I really enjoy telling my tale. I wonder if this is a sign of something.
After a while, I ask if I can get up and use the bathroom. I am a bit nervous, but I need a drink, and I want to check myself out in the mirror. I stand up, and I walk to the door, and I open it. I pause, and I turn back, and I look at the doctor. He smiles at me, and I smile back. I blush, and I close the door.
I return to my chair, and I continue my story. I say that I have never felt so much pressure before, and I had a hard time finding a way to deal with my feelings. I admit that I tried to lose my virginity at the age of sixteen, and I lost my nerve. I told a girl I liked her, and I asked if she wanted to come to my house, and I think I remember that the date didn't happen.

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Caitlin."   My parents were killed by terrorists during the Oklahoma City bombing, and I've been living alone ever since. It took years before I was able to start dating again, but now I have a boyfriend. My relationship isn't perfect, we argue all the time, but I think that this will get better once I find myself. 
Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding his head and smiling at me while I speak, occasionally interjecting a question or two. He looks thoughtful when I finish speaking, then he asks, "Why do you want to date? What does that give you?"
"Well, I feel lonely sometimes. But my friends are important to me too, and I don't know what else to do. If there was another way..."
He nods sympathetically, "Yes, I can understand that. The pain of losing loved ones is very difficult to deal with. I remember when I lost my wife and daughter in a car accident. I felt helpless, I didn't know what to do, I just wanted them back. You'll figure something out, I'm sure. I'm sure things will work out for the best. I'm sure you'll meet someone special, and they'll help to fill the void. And I hope you'll let me know if I can be of assistance to you in any way, I'm always willing to help people in need. Now, if you would please tell me about the situation in which you found yourself, I'm sure I can be of more aid to you than I already am."
I look at the doctor, and I realize that I trust him. I open my mouth to talk, and I begin telling my story, and I keep talking until I reach the end. I pause for a moment to catch my breath, and I ask if I may use the restroom.
Dr. Szozas smiles at me, "Of course, go

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Caitlyn Hensley. I am 24 years old, and I've been experiencing disturbing thoughts since about 3 months ago." 
He looks up at me curiously, and asks, "What sort of thoughts?"
"Well, I have dreams where I... 
he interrupts me before I can finish, "Caitlyn, let's start with a little history. Please tell me exactly what happened three months ago, starting at the beginning."
So I explain that I was working late at work one night, and after putting in another long shift without any breaks or lunch break, I decided to get home early. As I drove through the parking lot, I noticed a car pull away from its spot. It seemed strange to me because the place is usually pretty busy at this time of the evening.
Then I thought I saw a person run out into the street, but by the time I looked closer, I realized the person wasn't running but rather walking slowly. I slowed down and watched the person walk into the road, and then I heard the sound of the collision. The impact jolted my body, and my head hit the steering wheel.
I woke up in the hospital, and I had a concussion and a broken leg. I had surgery to repair the damage, and I spent a few days in the ICU. When I finally got out, I went back to work, but I was still feeling off. I couldn't concentrate, and I felt tired all the time. I started having nightmares. I'd wake up in a cold sweat, soaked in perspiration, and my heart would race out of control.
I kept thinking about the accident, and I tried to avoid driving home. I didn't want to go anywhere near the scene, and I didn't know if I'd ever be able to drive again.
I just wanted to escape.
I found a new job, and I'm doing better now. I don

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Caitlin Smith. My parents were killed by terrorists about six months ago."  He nods, encouragingly, "Yes, we can discuss this later. Why don't you tell me what happened?"
"Well, they got caught up in a terrorist bombing that took place at a mall in Los Angeles, California. They died instantly. It was horrible... their bodies just exploded..."  I pause, trying to get my emotions under control, "...and then there was blood everywhere, and I couldn't do anything. The people that attacked them had guns pointed at me, too. When the police arrived, I ran away... I hid in an alleyway until nightfall, and then I came home. I didn't know where else to go.
When I woke up the next morning, I found myself in a hospital bed, surrounded by doctors and nurses. I asked one of the doctors for information about my parents, and she said I'd been involved in a car accident. I thought I remembered something similar happening, but I wasn't sure. I wanted to talk to my friend, but I lost her number. I looked online and found a listing for a doctor named Michael Szozas, and I emailed him. I've never met anyone like him before; he's a psychiatrist, and he sounds smart and wonderful. He recommended I come in for a consultation, and I agreed.
I need help. I feel stuck in a rut, and I don't want to stay in the house all the time. I'm afraid of my neighbors, but I also miss my friends and my family. What should I do?
Dr. Szozas responds:
Caitlin,
I am very sorry for the loss of your parents. You are not alone in feeling trapped or frightened. Many people experience such feelings in times of great stress. I think the best thing you can do is to explore these issues in a safe environment, and
