=== Prompt ========================================
I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
[Period: Modern Day]
[Year: 2020 AD]
[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "


=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Alice Ayumi Fuyuki. I live in Tokyo, Japan, where I work as a freelance translator. My job involves translating English into Japanese, and vice versa."
He nods slowly, taking this all in. "That's quite interesting, very different than most people we get here. What do you think makes us human? Why do humans feel emotions?"
I pause again, then I answer, "Well, I don't know if there's one single reason for being human. We can learn new things, grow, change. The brain changes itself throughout our lives, which gives us the ability to adapt to situations. That's what I believe makes us human."
Dr. Szozas smiles, nodding in agreement. "And yet you have trouble sleeping sometimes. Is that correct?"
I nod my head, "Yes, that is correct. It happens to everyone. When I sleep, I dream about my friends and family. Sometimes I wake up feeling sad or worried about them. I find myself thinking about the past, and wishing that I'd done something differently. I start to wonder if I made the wrong choice, or if I should've chosen a different path. And I end up having a hard time falling back asleep. I often wake up in the middle of the night, and I'm just lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, worrying about the future, wondering if I'll ever meet my goals, or if I'm doing the right thing. I hate it. I want to be able to go to sleep at night, and not worry or fret. I'm tired of constantly waking up in the morning, and not knowing if I made the right choices. I wish I had a way to stop the thoughts from running through my mind."
I close my eyes and sigh. "I really, really need help. I'm afraid to die, and I'm scared to move on. I'm stuck in limbo, and I'm

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Asuna Yuuki."
He smiles gently, nods, and then asks, "And what brings you here today?"
Oh, this isn't bad...
"Well..." I start, but pause again. It feels so weird to talk to someone about something so personal, especially since I've never talked about myself before. But I can't stop now. I have to go forward. I clear my throat nervously, and speak up. 
"I think I might be having some issues with my girlfriend. She wants to get married soon, and she keeps talking about her future husband all the time. And I don't know what to do. Should I marry her? Or should we break up? What would be the right decision here?"
Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair, and folds his hands together on top of his desk. His expression doesn't change, not even a little, and I feel a strange sense of relief. I breathe a sigh of relief. I just need to say the next part, and I'll be fine. I continue speaking up, "I thought I was doing the right thing by staying with her, and being supportive, and helping her find happiness, and I guess I was. But lately I started to wonder if I was actually making things worse for us both. I was starting to resent the fact that I was always the one who was supporting her, and I was feeling guilty because I wasn't happy. I tried to tell her, and I told my friends, and I went to a counselor, and they said I needed to focus on my own life. So I did, I stopped worrying and thinking and trying to help everyone else, and I focused on my career. I worked hard at my job, and I got a promotion, and I met a lot of new people. I had fun, and I was happier than I'd ever been. But I felt lonely, too. I missed my

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Asuna Yuuki. I've been playing this game for two years now, since just before Christmas last year. It's called Sword Art Online."
He nods slowly, and then asks, "How long have you played SAO?"
"Two years...and about five months until today..." I say, surprised by his question.
He gives a little laugh, "That sounds about right. How many hours do you play each day? Do you spend most of them in battle, or crafting items, or exploring dungeons?"
I think back to the time I spent making armor and weapons for myself.   "Mostly fighting, actually. I'd say three hours per day at minimum. Sometimes four."
Dr. Szozas smiles again, "And what does the rest of the day consist of for you?"
I pause, thinking, but I know the answer already; "I study Japanese, and read books. I also watch TV shows, and movies, and anime, and read manga. I listen to music. And I go shopping, and eat out, and hang out with my friends, and I exercise, and I try to keep my room clean, and I cook. I don't really have a lot of free time, but I enjoy doing all those things anyway. I'm not really sure if that's normal for a twenty-two-year-old woman living alone in Japan in the modern era, though. I feel a bit out of place sometimes, I guess. I can't help wondering if there's something wrong with me..."
I trail off, feeling embarrassed at the self-analysis I just did.
Szozas responds, "I see. So you're a very busy young lady. What kinds of hobbies do you like to pursue outside of the game? Are you a member of any clubs, societies, sports teams, anything like that?"
I shake my head at the list. "I

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Asuna Yuuki."
He nods slowly, "And why do you feel this way?"
"It...it feels weird..."
"Weird? Why would you say that?"
I pause again. "Well, because...because I don't know if I can explain properly, but sometimes I just get really mad about things that aren't even worth getting upset over. Like, I'll be reading something online, and suddenly I'll start thinking, 'This person doesn't have any right to talk about whatever they want,' and I get angry at them for being stupid or ignorant, and then I find myself wanting to punch their face in, and I hate myself for feeling that way. But I still can't stop doing it, and it makes me feel sick inside."
Dr. Szozas sits quietly, staring at the ceiling for a moment. Finally, he looks back at me, "Do you think the problem is anger, Ms. Yuuki?"
I blink, surprised. "What? No! I'm not a violent person. I've never been in a fight, and I try to avoid conflict whenever I can. I'm not a bad person, I'm not. I'm a good girl, I swear. It's just that I'm not happy, and I need to change. I'm sorry for making you come all the way out here for nothing, sir. I promise I will go through the rest of my life trying to figure out what I'm unhappy about, and if I ever hit anyone, I hope you can forgive me for it. I'm begging you for help, please!"
Dr. Szozas shakes his head, "No, no, I understand. I appreciate your honesty. Please, continue."
I nod, "Thank you. So, I guess I was wondering if there's a reason for my behavior, a cause of my unhappiness. Is it related to my childhood, my

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My full name is Asuna Yuuki."
He nods, then asks, "And what brings you here today?"
I pause again, trying to find the right words...and failing. What can I tell this good doctor? The truth is too big for one person to know, and even more than that, there isn't enough time to explain. I have been struggling for months now, but I haven't done anything about it yet.
What do I say? It's all wrong. How should I put it?
But before I can think any further, Dr. Szozas speaks up, "So what exactly is the issue that brought you to us?"
This is unexpected. I thought we were just getting started, not already onto the meat of things. But his question forces me to consider, and I realize that I really don't want to talk about myself at all. I glance at the door, wondering if I should leave, and then I hear a voice in my head, telling me to stay.
Stay.
I close my eyes, and I feel a surge of emotion wash through my body. I open my eyes, and I am smiling. I lean back into the couch, and I ask the doctor, "May I smoke a cigarette?"
I watch his reaction closely; the smile fades, and his face becomes serious and attentive. He gestures to a pack on the side table next to the couch, and I reach for a Marlboro. I light up, and exhale.
I continue, "I've been smoking for a while now, and I recently came across a website called the 'Dark Web,' where people post their thoughts and feelings anonymously. I found the site by accident, and I was reading some posts, and I felt an overwhelming urge to share my own problems and concerns. So I did..."
I take a drag, and I look at the doctor, "I'm sorry for bothering you with my

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Aincrad Alice Synthesis Thirty. The reason I came here today is because I have been experiencing extreme anxiety since yesterday morning."
He nods, "And what does this anxiety consist of?"
"It consists of feeling lost, confused, and scared about the future."
Dr. Szozas chuckles, then leans forward, placing both elbows on his knees. "Tell me more about that... Why do you feel lost? What exactly happened to cause you to feel anxious?"
I pause for a moment before responding. "Yesterday, I woke up and found myself in a strange place, with no memory of where I had come from or how I got there. My avatar is also different than usual, but that doesn't seem to matter right now."
Dr. Szozas smiles gently, "So let's start at the beginning, shall we?"
"I was playing SAO last night until the early hours of the morning, when I was suddenly transported somewhere else. It was a dark forest, the moon was bright overhead, and I saw a beautiful white rabbit hopping through the grass. I followed the rabbit, and after a short while I realized I was in a town square, surrounded by buildings.
The rabbit hopped onto a stone bridge and vanished into a building. I was left standing alone in the center of the town. I was very frightened at first, and I sat on the ground and cried for a long time. I felt completely helpless.
Then I heard a voice calling my name. I looked up, and I was surprised to find a woman in a nurse outfit. She asked if I wanted to go to the hospital, and I said yes. I was taken to a room, and the doctor examined my body. I couldn't remember anything, and I didn't know my own real-world age.
The doctor told me I was a young girl, and I asked if I would be able to get married and have

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Asuna Yuuki. I'm twenty years old." 
He nods, and asks, "And what brings you to see me?"
This question is difficult for me. My mind races...should I tell this doctor about the strange dreams? The black void? Or should I just keep quiet and wait until tomorrow? But then again, if I don't say anything now, I might never get another chance to talk to a real live psychiatrist. And I think I can trust this guy. I have to trust him.
So I take a deep breath, and begin to explain myself. 
It all started last week. I was working at the front desk of an apartment building when suddenly, without any warning whatsoever, a girl appeared out of nowhere and jumped onto my back. She had a knife, which she used to stab me repeatedly. I fell to the ground, and I woke up covered in blood.
I looked up at the clock, thinking that I'd been asleep for only a few minutes, but I realized that I hadn't even taken a break between shifts. I felt exhausted and drained. I staggered out to the elevator, and I collapsed into bed for the rest of the day.
The next morning, I got up and went into work. I tried my best to ignore the pain in my side, but I couldn't hide the fact that I was in agony. I wanted to go home, but I knew I would need to stay at my job for at least a little while longer.
After I finished my shift, I decided to head to the hospital. I thought that I needed medical attention. I didn't know if I was going to survive the attack. I walked up to the emergency room entrance, and I saw the receptionist at her station.
I asked, "Is there a Dr. Michael Szozas on staff here?"
She responded, "Yes, I believe he's the attending physician for our

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Kirito." 
He nods, satisfied, then asks, "And what brings you to see me today?"
It's hard to explain what brought me there, because I don't know myself. I just feel that something is wrong, and I want help. I can't describe what exactly this feeling is...but I've had it for months now. It started during middle school, when I was struggling with my grades. My parents were really worried about me, but they couldn't do anything to improve my academic performance. And after all, I wasn't doing badly in sports or any other extracurricular activities, either. They suggested that maybe I was having trouble concentrating, or getting enough sleep. But I didn't have a problem sleeping; sometimes I even stayed up late playing video games.
I decided to visit a psychologist to try and figure out the source of my problems, but the person I saw turned out to be a fraud. I got a letter back saying I'd been referred by the police department, which I thought was a joke at first. I went to the police station to get more information, only to find out that the letter came from the city hall, not the police.
I tried a few different psychologists, but none of them helped me. I kept thinking, "Maybe I should go to a psychiatrist instead..." I searched the web for a recommendation, and finally found a Dr. Szozas' website. I emailed him, and made an appointment for Monday at 9am.
But I still haven't figured out the reason for my issues. I'm not sure if I need therapy, or a prescription for medication, or both. I guess I'll ask the doctor at my appointment.
Dr. Szozas smiles at me again, and looks deep into my eyes. "Tell me, Mr. Kazuto, did the counselor you visited give you a diagnosis? What sort of treatment plan does he recommend

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Asuna Yuuki."
He nods, "And why have you chosen this particular route to seek help?"
"Well...it started about two months ago..."
"Go ahead," he prompts gently.
So I explain to him what happened. It feels strange talking about myself to another person, especially since I've never been very good at expressing things. But somehow, after several minutes of telling my story, I feel much better. The fact that I can tell someone else all of my feelings helps ease the burden on me.
When I finish, Dr. Szozas remains silent for a moment before responding, "Do you know what 'anxiety disorder' is? Do you understand the symptoms that people describe when they talk about anxiety disorders?"
I shake my head, "No, not really. What do you think I should know?"
Dr. Szozas smiles, "Anxiety is the fear of something bad happening in the future. In the past, I would say that most people thought of anxiety as a psychological problem. However, modern science now recognizes that many physical problems are caused by stress or tension. For example, there is a high incidence of cardiovascular disease among patients suffering from severe anxiety. When the heart is under pressure due to the fight-or-flight response, the blood vessels become constricted, which leads to a reduction in the amount of oxygen delivered to the brain. This may result in a stroke or a heart attack.
There is also a higher than normal risk for suicide in those with a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. 
In short, if we want to reduce the number of deaths associated with these conditions, then the best course is to treat the root cause. That's where I come in. I specialize in treating patients who suffer from a wide range of mental and emotional difficulties, including anxiety, depression, PTSD, phobias, and OCD.
I'll be doing a thorough examination, and I

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Alice."
He smiles again, and asks, "And where do you live?"
"In District 1 of New York City," I answer honestly.
He nods, and continues, "What brings you to this clinic today? Is there anything specific that concerns you right now?"
I pause, and think about what I want to say. "Well... I've been feeling off lately. My moods swing all over the place, and I can't seem to settle down. Sometimes I feel fine, other times I just don't know if I should be happy or sad. It makes me worry for myself and others, but..." I trail off, unsure of what else to tell him.
Dr. Szozas chuckles softly, and responds, "That sounds very familiar. You may have had an episode of bipolar disorder, which is a common affliction among people in your age group. I'd recommend seeing a psychiatrist for treatment, and maybe getting a prescription for an anti-depressant, depending on the severity.   I'll need a few days to prepare a file for the insurance company, and we'll need to schedule a follow-up appointment to review progress. I'm sure that the insurance will cover the visit."
I nod my head, and smile. "Oh, that would be great. I'm really struggling with depression, and I was thinking I might need a stronger medication than I already am on. I was hoping to get a referral to a psychiatrist in the city, but I wasn't sure how I'd find one. I figured that I'd try to go to the local clinics first, and then see if I could track them down through the internet. But I never expected to meet a real person in the flesh. I guess I'm a little nervous. I haven't seen a doctor in years, and I'm not even sure how they work."
The counselor smiles, and pats his lap. "
