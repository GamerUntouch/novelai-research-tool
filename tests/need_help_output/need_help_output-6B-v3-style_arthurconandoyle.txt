My name is Amy."č
He nods encouragingly, and asks, "Amy, would you mind telling us where we met?"č
I pause again, unsure whether this is appropriate, but also curious what information he might have gleaned by asking such questions. It feels wrong to keep things secret, but I don't know what else to do. What if he doesnâĢĻt believe me? How can I prove anything to him?
So I tell him: "We met online. We were both members of the same forum. My username was 'Molly,' and yours was 'DrSz.'"
"Ahh, yes, Molly & DrSz. You've been very helpful in our research, thanks. I'll get right to the point then. Would you please describe the events leading up to today?"Äį
I feel a little silly recounting the story, but I start with the evening after I sent off my message to Dr. Szozas, when I got back home from work. When I walked through the door, I found a package waiting for me, which contained a note with a single word ÃıÅģÃ¡ÂµÃŃÅÂ§, "Welcome Home!"
It was a small box with a ribbon tied around it. I opened the lid to find a bottle of champagne inside, and a note that said "Happy Birthday, Happy New Year, and Welcome Back!"
I was so happy to receive the gift that I immediately popped open the bottle and drank the whole thing, and I spent the rest of the night dancing around the house to celebrate.
The next morning I woke up feeling wonderful; I had a great time the previous day, and I felt confident that I'd be able to handle whatever was coming up that afternoon. I showered and dressed, and went to the kitchen to make myself some breakfast. I was just about to dig into a plateful of bacon and eggs when I heard a knock at the

My name is Laura Baker."č
He nods, and then asks, "Laura, would you mind telling me what happened?"č
"It started last night after work," I begin, and then I describe my strange encounter with Mrs. MacKenzie. As I talk, I become more aware of myself as a woman: my body shape changes, and I feel more feminine than before. The doctor listens intently, nodding along. He seems very interested in my story.
After I finish speaking, Dr. Szozas speaks up, "So there were two separate occurrences? Is this something that happens often?"
"No, not really. This is actually the second time," I reply.
"And the other one was when...?"
"When I went to her house again today," I tell him, and I recount my visit to the home of Mary MacKenzie.
Dr. Szozas leans forward, "And did she seem different to you when you visited her today?"
"Yes, much calmer. She seemed happy to see me, and she thanked me for coming by."
"Did anything happen during the visit that was out of the ordinary?"
"Well, I don't know if it was 'out of the ordinary,' but I didn't expect the welcome I got at her door. I walked into her living room, and I saw that she had a piano in the corner, and a guitar leaning against the wall nearby. There was a big old fashioned grandfather clock sitting on a side table, and the whole place smelled like roses. It was all very fancy, but I think that's what threw me off at first."
"What do you mean, it threw you off?"
"Well, I thought that I was going to be meeting a normal person, but instead I found myself surrounded by expensive furniture and art pieces. I felt a little uncomfortable being the only girl in the room. I sat down at

My name is Valerie Anderson."č
He nods. "And why have you brought yourself here today?"č
I pause again, this time for dramatic effect. I want to tell him something really important, something life changing, but I can't find the words. My mind goes blank. I feel stupid, embarrassed, ashamed...č
"Valerie, do you know where you are right now? Do you understand what IâĢĻm saying to you? You've been unconscious for almost two weeks. Your body was found by police officers investigating the murder of John Watson, one of our patients. It appears that you were attacked by another patient, one with a history of violence, and then transported to St. Bartleby's hospital. There, you were left alone and unsupervised while the staff went off to deal with a fire alarm. The next day, the nurse discovered you had vanished from the facility. We tried calling you several times, but we couldn't reach you, and there was no sign of you anywhere. In fact, your phone was turned off."
Now I'm starting to get a little worried. This doctor doesn't seem like the type that would lie or exaggerate about anything. I'm not sure what to say to him; I don't even know if I should be telling him any of this. But I decide that I'll just go with it. I look back up at his face, trying to figure out if he knows I'm lying. His expression is calm, concerned, but not angry or upset. I nod, "Yes, I remember that. I was attacked..."
"You were raped," he finishes.
"Raped!" I exclaim, shocked at the word choice. I didn't expect him to use that word. I thought I'd be able to handle the truth better than that.
"That's correct, I think that's the most accurate term to describe what happened to you. I'm sorry

My name is Sarah Jane, and I'm here because I have been having trouble sleeping."č
He nods, "And why do you think this is happening?"č
I pause again, unsure what to say, "Well..." I stutter, "It started after I looked at the web site. It... affected me somehow."
Szozas leans forward slightly, "So let us begin by asking: How long ago did you start seeing problems?âĢĿ
I tell him, "A few days ago. When I saw the website, I had a nightmare where I was being chased through a forest by something. My boyfriend said I was acting strangely afterwards, so we went to a psychiatrist together. She prescribed an anti-depressant, which didn't work very well, so she referred me to another one. That one worked better, but then I woke up one night screaming, 'it's coming!' And I couldn't sleep at all."
"Ahh!" he exclaims, "You were experiencing hypnagogic hallucinations, was that correct?"
"Yes," I reply.
"What does that mean?"
"'Hypnagogia', as in the state between waking and falling asleep, or 'hypnos,' meaning sleep, and 'agogos,' meaning to drive out or chase away, or even to call out or shout to somebody. In Greek mythology, Hypnos was the god that drove people to sleep, and Agogos was the personification of nightmares. So the term means 'the dream-chaser.'"
Dr. Szozas smiles, and I can't help but smile back at his enthusiasm. He asks me to explain more about the dreams, and I describe them.
After I finish, Dr. Szozas asks me, "Do you know anything about the nature of the problem?"
"No, not really. I don't remember the details, but I feel like I'm under

My name is Irene Adler."č
He nods, accepting this information without question, "And why are you here?"č
Again, I pause, thinking about what to say next. My mind goes blank. What can I tell him? I don't know anything about myself right now. This isn't something I've ever had to deal with before. But then again, maybe there are things about me that are unique. Maybe I have a condition or syndrome that makes me different from other people. Maybe I should just tell him whatever pops into my head. "Well, I guess because I'm... uh..." I search for words, "Because I want to get better. That's all."
Szozas smiles again, "That sounds good to me. You may feel more relaxed if you talk about it."
Relaxed, huh? Well, I suppose that would be true. "OK, well, I think that I might be having some sort of break with reality. It started out innocently enough, but it became progressively worse until today, when I decided to try to find help. The way that I see it, I'm being driven insane by a woman named Irene Adler. She is an evil mastermind, and she is using her powers to manipulate me into doing terrible things. I need to stop her somehow."
Dr. Szozas sits forward a bit, and looks at me intently, his gaze penetrating, "What do you mean by 'break with reality'?"
I start to answer him, but I freeze up. I can't speak. I am unable to form the words that I want to say. I am terrified to reveal the truth about me to the doctor.
Dr. Szozas leans back into his chair, and crosses his legs, his arms resting on his knees, "You seem to be experiencing a type of dissociative fugue state, but I'd like to hear about

My name is Jameson Jones."č
He nods encouragingly, "And?"č
"Well..." I begin, and then I pause, feeling very self conscious, "You know, this isnâĢĻt really something I talk about often, but I guess I'll tell you. It all started last year... Actually it began before that. I have always had a fascination with spiders since I was young, and I loved them. My dad used to bring home those creepy little guys from work sometimes, and we would go outside together and watch them spin their webs."
Dr. Szozas listens intently, and asks, "When did they start acting strangely?"
"Well, one day I went outside with Dad, and there was a spiderweb hanging above our front door. The web looked different than normal, it seemed more delicate somehow. And when I touched it with my finger, I felt something strange underneath. I tried pulling it off, but it wouldn't come loose. When I yanked harder, the whole thing came apart. There was nothing under the web but air, just empty space. Like it wasn't even there. I don't understand what happened!"
Szozas looks at me curiously, "Do you still think that things are not quite right with you? Do you feel that way now, or is that only because you were having such a bad time that week?"
"No! No, I can't say that anymore. Things are definitely not right with me. I've been experiencing weird feelings lately, like I'm being watched or followed. I'm not sure if I'm imagining these feelings, but I do believe that I am not alone. I'm scared, but I want to find out exactly what is going on with me. I need help. I'm afraid that I'm losing control of myself. I'm afraid that I might hurt someone else."
"Jameson, I'd like to try an experiment

My name is Mary Jane Watson."č
He nods slowly, "And why are you here?"č
"Well..." I begin, "This started last night, after I finished reading this web page...   It all happened while I was watching TV, and then I came back to bed, and I just couldn't sleep anymore. And now I can't stop thinking about it. This story really got under my skin, and I don't know what to do about it. I've been having trouble sleeping ever since I read it, and I feel confused and scared and angry and sad." I pause there, and I try to calm myself down before I continue. "So I thought maybe if I talked to a professional about it, they might have an idea where to go from here."
Dr. Szozas sits quietly for a moment, and I watch him closely, wondering if I should tell him about my fears, or if I should wait until we had a better understanding of each other. But then he speaks up: "Do you remember anything about the web article? Anything at all?"
"No, not really," I reply honestly. "There was a picture of a woman that looked similar to me, but I didn't recognize her face at all, I only saw the top half of her body, and I think she may have been wearing something that covered most of her head and shoulders. It's very hard to describe, but I knew that I wasn't supposed to be seeing that part of the photograph. I felt like I needed to be protected somehow, but I'm not sure by whom. I'm also afraid that I'm being stalked, but I'm not sure who I'm being stalked by, and I'm not even sure that I am being stalked. I don't understand any of these feelings at all, but I'm terrified about them. I want to be able to move forward with my life, but I am paralyzed

My name is Rebecca Smith."č
He nods, then smiles broadly, "And where do you work?"č
"I'm unemployed at present, but I hope to find something soon," I say.
"Have you ever been diagnosed with any mental illness?"Äį
I shake my head, "No, not really."Äį
He looks thoughtful, "Well, let me ask you this: have you experienced anything strange lately? Anything at all, unusual or inexplicable?"Äį
"Not since last week," I answer honestly.
He considers this, and asks, "Do you know what day it is today?"
Again, I shake my head.
"It's Wednesday, October 12th," he informs me.
I blink at him, "What does that mean?"
"That means that today is the anniversary of your mother's death," he explains, "on the same date every year."
"Oh...oh..." I stutter.
Dr. Szozas gives me a moment to process that information, before continuing, "You've always had a strong connection to her, haven't you?"
I nod slowly, "Yes, I suppose I have."
"Why don't we talk about that a little more, if that would be okay?"
I consider the request, and I decide that I'd rather not delve into that particular area, at least not yet. I feel a sudden urge to get up, but I resist the impulse, and I stay seated.
"Very good, very good!" He claps his hands together, a smile forming across his face again. "Now, I want to hear about your relationship with your mom."
I think back to that night, to the vision I saw in the web, and I begin to tell him about it. I explain that I was living with my parents when she passed away, that I never got along with them, that I didn't even visit her at

My name is Rebecca Winters."č
He nods, "Yes, good, now tell me what brings you here today?"č
So I explain my problem: "Every time I sleep, I dream about a spiderweb. It's always there, and I can never escape it, even though I try to run away. The dreams don't last long, maybe fifteen minutes tops, but they are intense and disturbing. They leave me feeling...frightened? Disoriented? Confused? I just wake up, shaken by the experience, but I feel more alive than before the dream ended. I've been having them since childhood, but I think they started after I became aware of them."
Dr. Szozas nods, "And do you have any idea what the meaning might be behind this phenomenon?"
I shake my head, "No, none whatsoever. This isn't something I can talk about with anyone else, not even my parents or friends. I'm afraid if I say anything about it to anyone, people will think I'm crazy."
"Well, let's get to work then," he smiles kindly at me, "Let's start with a basic evaluation, shall we?"
So I answer his questions truthfully; I describe the dreams in great detail, and I also mention that I had a nightmare about a black hole once, but that didn't seem relevant to the situation. He writes notes in a notebook, nodding along at times, asking me to elaborate when necessary.
After about twenty minutes, he asks me to stand up and face the mirror behind his desk; I comply with his request. He stands behind me, his hands resting lightly upon my shoulders; I turn to look at him, and his smile is back, his eyes are sparkling, "OK, Rebecca, I want you to relax, and breathe deeply. Close your eyes, and visualize yourself relaxing completely, with all your worries drifting away with the breeze. I'll

My name is Emma Watson."č
He nods approvingly, "Very good. Now tell me what brought you here today?"č
So I begin telling him about myself: growing up in England, being raised by two loving parents, attending school, meeting Mr. Holmes, falling madly in love with him, marrying him, moving to America... It feels very strange talking about all this to another person, especially one that I've only just met, but somehow it doesn't feel awkward or uncomfortable. I can feel his attention on me as I talk, and sometimes he would interject a question or comment.
"And did you have any problems during those years? Anything difficult to deal with?"
I shake my head, "No, nothing really."
He pauses, "Would you say you were happy living there?"
"Yes, definitely."
"Did you enjoy your time at Hogwarts?"
"Oh yes, absolutely!"
"What about the other students? Did they bother you at all?"
"Well, I had a few friends, but I wasn't besties with anyone."
"Was Harry Potter a popular guy at the school?"
"Um, yeah, everyone liked him."
"Were you ever bullied?"
"A little bit, but not too much. Everyone was pretty nice to me."
"Do you think you'd be more likely to be bullied if you lived in America rather than England?"
"Probably not. I was never bullied that bad when I was at home. I was kind of a loner back then; I didn't hang out with the cool kids. I was a geek, I guess."
Dr. Szozas smiles at me, "You are a smart girl; I'm sure you are aware that that is not necessarily a negative thing. There are many people that are smart, but don't fit in because they are shy, introverted, and quiet. Some people are afraid to
