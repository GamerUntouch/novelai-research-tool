=== Prompt ========================================
I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.

[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "


=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Tom Thumb, and I've been having problems." I don't know exactly what those problems are, but they seem important, and I want them resolved. That's what I said, and I can tell by his reaction that I have done something right.   He smiles again, and leans forward to place a gentle palm on my shoulder, "Tell me more about your problem, Tom."
So I do. I start talking, telling this story of a boy named Nicky, and then I talk about my own feelings. I describe the strange things happening to me, and I try not to laugh too hard at myself, but I find myself doing that quite often.
Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding along, smiling occasionally. He asks questions when I pause for breath, and I answer. I think I'm making sense to him, but I don't really know. I'm pretty sure I'm getting a lot across to him, though.
I feel better after I finish my tale, and I relax back into the cushions. I close my eyes, and rest my head against the side of the sofa. I hear the doctor's voice asking a question, and I open my eyes.
"Tom, I'm going to ask you a couple of questions, and I'd appreciate if you answered honestly. I'll give you a moment to consider each one, and if you aren't ready, please just say 'no'.
Do you ever masturbate?"
I blink, startled. "What? No, never. I hate touching my penis."
He nods. "Have you ever had any sexual contact with another person other than masturbation, oral sex, or intercourse?"
I shake my head. "No, I haven't touched a girl's breasts, vagina, anus, anything like that. I'm afraid of the smell, and the taste, and I get an erection when I touch my penis, and I

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Jennifer Marie Smith, age 30, and I'm married."
He nods, "OK, good start."
I go on, "I have been seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive!"
Szozas smiles, "Thank you, yes, I know what you mean."
I continue, "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor. Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am."
Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair, and his smile widens, "That was very well done, Ms. Smith. Thank you for taking the time to come in today. I hope that we can work together to get to the bottom of this problem of yours. 
I nod, "Yes, thank you for being so understanding."
Dr. Szozas stands up from his chair, and he extends his hand to me, "You are most welcome, and I do appreciate the effort. Let's begin by getting to know each other better; I want to hear more about you, and I'd like for you to tell me a little bit about yourself. I promise I won't bite!"
I laugh, "I'm a single mom, I live in a small town in the Midwest. I am a nurse at a local hospital. I'm also a part-time waitress for a family restaurant. I

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is John Smith."
He nods, and asks again, "And why are you here?"
I pause, then answer, "I have been having issues with my girlfriend, and I think she may be cheating on me. I want to know if this is true, and if so, what can I do about it? And if not, then why would she cheat on me?"
Szozas sits back in his chair, and thinks for a moment before responding, "So let's start by getting some facts straight. What is her name?"
I tell him, "Jane Doe".
"What does Jane Doe look like?"
"She is 5 foot 6 inches, brown hair, blue eyes, slim body. She works out at the gym regularly and looks great doing it.   We met at a party, we were both there for different reasons, but somehow we ended up talking. I don't remember exactly where the conversation started, but I do recall that I had a lot more fun than I expected. I felt something between us, and I wanted to spend time with her. I was interested in learning more about her, but I didn't realize just how much I was attracted to her. I guess I was flirting a little, and I was surprised when she said yes to a second date. I thought the first one was a mistake, but I was wrong. I found myself thinking about her a lot. I was hoping that maybe I could get to know her better, and I knew I should probably slow things down, but I couldn't help myself. I kept trying to find excuses to see her.
I was afraid to ask, because I wasn't sure if I'd get an answer. But I did anyway, and I asked her out for a third date. I was nervous that I might scare her off, and I also worried that I was pushing too fast. I really liked her, and I hoped she felt

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Jennifer Marie Smith." I pause, waiting for him to continue. When he doesn't say anything, I add, "I don't know what else to tell you. I just want help figuring things out. My life isn't working right now."
He nods, and leans back in the chair, crossing one leg over the other. A thoughtful expression crosses his face, and then he asks, "What do you think about?"
Oh gosh, I feel silly. This guy is smart and good-looking and all those other wonderful adjectives, but I can't answer that question without sounding stupid. I sigh, and try again, "I guess I've been thinking about...well, sex? That's what I was hoping to talk about. But I guess there's more to the problem than just my lack of interest in men."
I wait for a reply, and I hear a faint chuckle coming from the doctor.   He gets up out of the chair, and moves to stand beside the couch where I am seated. I watch him approach, and I wonder if this is the part where he tells me I have a nice body. I find myself wishing for the blue dress, the heels, and the sexy underwear. I wish for the tingle to run up my spine, and the butterflies in my stomach, and the desire for him. I would give anything for him to touch me, to hold me, to kiss me.
I should be embarrassed by my thoughts, and I suppose I will be later, but for now I'm enjoying the feeling of being wanted. He stops before the couch, and I turn my head to look up at him. I expect a smile, or a wink, or something along those lines, but I get a shock when he puts his hands on my shoulders, and bends to press his lips against mine.
The surprise is a pleasant one, and I open my mouth to accept his tongue into my

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Janae Kincaid, and I have been experiencing problems."
He nods, and asks, "What sort of problems?"
I answer, "Well, I've been having trouble sleeping lately, which makes me cranky, and then I get really depressed, and sometimes angry, and I don't know what to do about it."
Dr. Szozas smiles at me, and says, "And how long have you had this problem?"
"About six months now."
Dr. Szozas nods again, and says, "Do you think there might be any connection between the two?"
I pause, and ponder a moment, and I say, "No, not that I can tell. It just started happening all at once, but I don't believe they're connected. I mean, I'm not sure if I should even call them related, I mean, maybe I'm just being silly, and I shouldn't worry myself about it. I'm sure I'll figure something out soon enough, and I'm sure I'll feel better when I do. I hope.
I glance at Dr. Szozas, and he is nodding at me, and saying, "I agree, I'm sure you will. We need to start by talking a little more about you, and I'd like you to give me a brief overview of your life. Can you do that for me?
I nod my head, and reply, "Sure, go ahead."
I explain my childhood and adolescence, and my education, and my marriage, and my divorce, and my new job, and my new apartment, and my friends, and my hobbies, and my family history, and my medical history, and my psychiatric history, and my medication, and my therapy, and my therapist, and my support group, and my work, and my boss, and my coworkers, and my neighbors, and my parents, and my brother,

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Robert Smith, and I've been seeing a counselor about an issue I'm having."
He nods, and then asks, "Can you tell me what this problem is?"
I sigh, and say, "Well, I guess I don't know yet..."
And now we have a conversation, and I feel much better. We talk for almost two hours, and I leave feeling more confident than before I came. I'll definitely go back again.
Afterwards, I went home and emailed Dr. Szozas to thank him for his time, advice, and help. He wrote back saying that it was a pleasure meeting me, and asking if I would consider coming to one of his seminars sometime. 
I think about the seminar idea for a few days, but I decide against it. I can get there by myself, and I'd rather spend my money on something else. Besides, I find that I enjoy talking with people in person a lot more.
I email Dr. Szozas thanking him for his willingness to meet with me, and telling him I hope I will see him soon.
We exchange emails for a while, until I hear nothing for a month. I start getting concerned, thinking maybe I should just give up on the whole thing. I decided to call, and ask, "Hey Michael, are you still taking appointments for counseling? I heard from a friend that you were good at helping them deal with problems, and I wondered, well, I didn't want to bother you, and I thought I might try and schedule an appointment for next week at the same time I saw you last time, is that OK?"
I waited a minute, and I heard a deep chuckle, and I knew he had seen the message. "You know I am always happy to see a new patient, and I do appreciate your interest in my work," he said. "I'm sorry I haven't responded sooner; my secretary is

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Amy Johnson. I've been seeing Dr. Szozas about an issue that I have."
He nods, and then asks, "What would you say is the nature of this problem?"
"Well, I think there might be something wrong with me. It started one night when I had a dream... I dreamed that I was a little girl again, but all grown up, and I thought I looked pretty good. The next day I woke up feeling very horny, and I masturbated thinking about being a young woman. That was the beginning of what happened after that."
Dr. Szozas listens attentively, and he doesn't interrupt me once. When I finish speaking, he nods, "It sounds to me like you were sexually abused by a relative at an early age."
I nod back, "Yes, I suppose I was. I don't know if I can explain exactly what happened, but when I got older, I developed a habit of fantasizing about women. I also became obsessed with sex, I wanted to be a porn star, I even considered becoming a stripper or a prostitute.  I guess I just really enjoyed having sex, and the more I did it, the more I liked it. I began to feel that I didn't want to ever stop doing it. I loved the way it made my body feel, and the pleasure I felt. I couldn't get enough. I wanted to do it constantly, and I wasn't satisfied unless I was getting fucked. I tried everything. I experimented, I learned, I explored, and eventually I found myself in a relationship. But I never stopped fucking. I still need to fuck, and I always will. I can't help it, I love the taste, and the smell, and the sensation. I love the feeling, especially when I cum. I love the orgasm, and the feeling afterwards. I love the power I have when I use my mouth on a

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is... My name is..." I pause, then continue, "It doesn't matter."
He smiles again, "That's good. What do you think is happening?"
I shrug, "I don't know."
"Well, let's start by getting a sense of what you've been experiencing lately.   Tell me about the last time you felt this way," he asks.
So I tell him about the day before yesterday, and I describe the feeling that came over me, and the anger I feel now. He listens intently, nodding along with my description of my feelings.
When I finish, he nods, "And when did those feelings begin? Was there a trigger event or something else that triggered them?"
I sigh, and I say, "I don't know. I just started having these feelings, and they're driving me crazy. It feels like I can't stop thinking about sex, and I want to have sex all the time!"
Dr. Szozas grins at me, "Hmmmmm, I'd like to hear more about the thoughts that are occurring to you, and the feelings you're having. I'll ask a few questions, and I want you to answer honestly, and without judgment. I promise not to judge, and I won't push any buttons, but I need to understand. Tell me about the most recent thought, and the strongest emotion associated with it."
I nod, and I try to explain, "I'm horny, and I want to fuck. I want to get fucked, and I want to cum on a cock. I want to suck a big dick, I want to swallow a load, and I want to be fucked hard. I want to be pounded into oblivion, and I want to beg for more. I want a huge fat fucking cock, and I want to hold onto it, and I want to keep sucking and swallowing until I'm totally drained. I

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Margaret Smith, and I came because I want to know what happened to my husband."
He nods, and then asks, "Would you mind telling me what led up to this?"
I continue, "Well, we were married for two years before I got pregnant with our daughter. We had been living together for about three months before she was born. My father died four days after her birth, and my mother died five weeks later. She was only eight months old when she passed away. I was devastated, but I knew that I needed to provide for my child somehow, so I went back to school and earned a bachelor degree in accounting.
"I worked hard for several years, and saved enough money to buy a small house, which I rented out until I started making more than the rent. I bought a car, and I put my savings into a 401K plan and an IRA account. I used the rental income for the mortgage and the taxes on the property, and I paid off my credit cards and the loan on my car.
"Then I met my now ex-husband. He offered to pay for my college education, and I accepted. He said he would support us both, and I believed him. He is a good provider, and I thought I loved him. 
"We moved in together, and I quit my job. He didn't work, and I did most of the household chores. He even helped out a little at the office where I worked, and I never asked him for any financial help at all. I was a good wife, and I wanted him to think I was a great one too.
"After a year or so, I found out that he wasn't supporting me at all. He spent the money on himself, and I was left to do everything on my own. I couldn't understand why he wouldn't help. I tried to get a job, and I really applied myself. I just

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Janae Smith." I pause again, "I don't know what else to tell you. It all started yesterday... I woke up feeling really strange, and then this morning, I had this weird dream..." I stop myself there, and just let the words hang in the air between us.
He looks at me expectantly, waiting for more information. I feel silly talking about dreams, but I do want to get to the point where I can explain things to him, without sounding crazy or paranoid. I continue after a short silence, "Well, in my dream, I was walking through an old house, and I came across a room with two doors, one leading out, the other to a hallway. There were people in the hall, but they didn't seem to notice me. When I opened the door, I found a big empty space, and I thought something bad might happen if I went in there. But, when I turned back to go outside, I saw a woman standing in the doorway of the room I'd been in, and she said to me, 'You have to come with me.'"
Dr. Szozas is listening intently now, and I am wondering if I've made a mistake. I should probably start at the beginning.
I close my eyes and try to recall what happened the day before, "I woke up early, and I felt really tired. I couldn't sleep. I tried to read, and I kept falling asleep. I got up, and I looked out the window, and I noticed the sun coming up. I decided to watch the sunrise on the beach, and I walked out the door and onto the deck, and the sky was purple, and the clouds were orange, and the sand was white. The water was calm, and I watched for a while, and I think I fell asleep at some point.
When I awoke, I found that I wasn't on my bed anymore.
