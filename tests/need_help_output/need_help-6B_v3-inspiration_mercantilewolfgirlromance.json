  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

Who might that be?\"\nI give him her name, which makes him smile again, \"So she suggested you contact me because you were having problems with your sex life?\"\nNow I blush furiously, embarrassed by my own lack of sophistication. What a stupid reason to seek help. It's embarrassing enough that I would have come here without even knowing the problem myself. The embarrassment only gets worse when I realize that I can't find any words to say.\nDr. Szozas laughs heartily, \"Don't worry about it. Just tell me exactly what happened.\"\nI try to get the story out, but I don't want to talk about the details. Instead, I describe the situation that led up to me coming to his office, and how I was feeling at the time.\nWhen I finish talking, Dr. Szozas sits quietly for several moments before responding, \"Hmhm. Well, I guess I'll start with the basics: we need to determine if you are suffering from a mental disorder or not. There are two ways to do that, the first is to use the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM), the other is to perform a clinical interview. I'm not sure if the web site gave you all the information that you needed, but if they did, I'd suggest that you go with the DSM method. You won't be able to decide if you are or are not mentally ill based on the results of the interview alone, but the interviews are more thorough than the standard questionnaires. I'm going to ask a few questions now, but please answer honestly. This will allow us to determine",
