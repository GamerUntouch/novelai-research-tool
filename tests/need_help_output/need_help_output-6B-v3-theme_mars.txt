My name is Adrienne Sorensen."
He smiles back at me again, "And why are you here?"
"Well..." I start hesitantly. The truth is that I don't know why I'm here. But I do have some suspicions, and they are causing me great distress. I want to talk to this doctor about them. If I can get him to understand what is happening to me... maybe we can figure something out together. Maybe we can stop whatever it is before it gets worse.
"I think I may be having some sort of psychotic break," I say softly.
Dr. Szozas leans forward, intrigued by my words, "Psychotic? What makes you believe that?"
"A few things happened recently, and I started getting really depressed, then angry. And I began seeing strange images, or hearing voices. They were just too much for me to handle. I felt trapped, I felt helpless, and I couldn't escape."
"How long ago did all of these events begin?" he asks gently.
"It was about two weeks ago when I got upset with my parents. It escalated after that. My dad came home one day, and found me crying uncontrollably. I had been screaming at him, calling him names. He was very confused. He tried to calm me down, but I wouldn't listen to anything he said. I stormed off to our room, slamming the door behind me. I spent the rest of the night there. I didn't go to school the next morning, nor the following days. I slept most of the time, and I only ate a little bit. I became more and more withdrawn, until I finally called up a friend to come pick me up. I left the house with her, but I still wasn't myself. I kept staring at the floor and mumbling to myself. I barely spoke to anyone. I remember asking a girl I knew if she would

My name is Nia Williams."
He nods. "And why did you choose to seek help?"
I swallow hard, unsure where this conversation is headed. "Well... I don't know..."
"Nia, please tell me what happened to cause you to feel this way? You have been acting strangely since we started talking yesterday afternoon. Your behavior has changed drastically. Why do you think this is happening to you?"
This is all new territory for me; I've never felt this off before. It feels weird. But I can't just say nothing, because he will wonder why I didn't answer his question. My mind races frantically, trying to figure out how best to explain myself without being too vague or giving away any details that might be sensitive or embarrassing. Finally, I decide to go with the truth: "It's like there's something inside me that wants to get out. Something dark and evil that wants to consume me, to destroy me. It feels like an alien parasite infecting my body, but I don't want to believe it; I don't want to accept that I am insane."
Dr. Szozas chuckles softly, "That sounds a lot like schizophrenia, which is actually quite common among those with Asperger's Syndrome. And I suspect that the reason you are experiencing such a profound change in personality is that the infection is causing a severe mental breakdown, possibly even a psychotic break. In addition to the physical symptoms that accompany psychosis, people with AS often experience a complete lack of empathy, a total inability to understand the feelings of others. They also tend to become socially isolated; they may not recognize the emotions of other people, and may appear to be coldly aloof. I would recommend that you undergo a thorough psychiatric evaluation to determine if the onset of these symptoms is a result of the infection."
"What about the dreams I had? The ones that were very vivid and disturbing. What is that about?" I

My name is Hannah Kelly."
He nods, and asks again, "Why are you here?"
This time I answer more confidently, "Well, I've been having trouble sleeping lately, and I've noticed that whenever I do sleep, I have weird dreams. They don't feel real, they just seem unreal. Sometimes I wake up screaming. It started after we had our baby, and I haven't slept since then. And now I can't stop thinking about this stuff..." I trail off, feeling embarrassed, I think I might cry, but before I know what I'm doing, I start bawling. The tears roll down my cheeks, and drip onto my lap. My whole body shakes, and I sniffle loudly, trying to hide the sound of crying by blowing air through my nose.
Dr. Szozas stands up, and approaches me, and puts his arms around me gently, and holds me tight against his chest. "It's ok," he whispers into my ear, "it's okay to let it all out... I promise you that whatever happens next will help you get better." He pats me lightly on the back, and sits back down in his chair.
As I regain control of myself, I look up at him, and I ask, "Can I talk about the things that are bothering me? Do you mind?"
He smiles kindly at me, and tells me to go ahead. I wipe away the last of the tears from my face with the sleeve of my shirt, and I begin to tell him about the nightmares that I am having.
They are always the same: I am a young girl, maybe twelve or thirteen years old, I'm walking along a dirt road, and I hear a car coming up behind me. I turn to look at the vehicle, but I am unable to see the driver because the windows are tinted dark. I look up at the sky, but there is no moon tonight,

My name is Rachel."
He nods, and then asks, "Why did you decide to seek professional counseling?"
It feels odd being asked this question by another person. It makes me feel vulnerable somehow, and yet also strangely excited too. What does one say? "Well... I've been having trouble sleeping lately."
He smiles gently, and then sits forward in his chair, "And what do you think might be causing the insomnia?"
Oh wow, that's such an easy answer. I blurt it out before thinking, "There's something wrong with me. Something inside me, making me unable to sleep soundly. I can't explain it any better than that. And I have tried all sorts of things..."
He cuts me off mid sentence, "Tell me more about the problems you are experiencing with sleeplessness."
So I tell him about the nightmares I had last night, about how I woke up screaming, and how I couldn't get back to sleep again. He listens intently, nodding now and then when I describe a dream or nightmare vividly enough. At times, his head would shake slightly, and he'd grimace while I was describing a particularly bad episode.
When I finish talking about the most recent incident, he leans back into his chair, "Now, let me ask a few questions: Have you ever experienced anything similar to that in the past? Do you recall a time where you were feeling very stressed out, perhaps with a job that required a lot of work and responsibility, or maybe a relationship that wasn't working out well?"
I nod, "Yes to both questions. I'm a student at a community college, and I'm taking a couple classes online. I'm really busy with schoolwork, but I'm doing pretty well overall. I'm not sure if I'm a good student though. I never seem to learn the material well, even after I study hard. I'm just not able to retain the

My name is Samantha Krieger." And then I pause, because there is something strange happening. It feels as though this doctor knows all about me. My heart starts beating faster, and my breathing quickens...I can feel myself becoming flushed.
He smiles again, and asks, "And what brings you to me today?"
I want to tell him, but I don't know where to start, or if I should even say anything at all. The doctor looks concerned, and I realize that he probably thinks I'm crazy or schizophrenic. But I'm not, really. I've just been feeling weird lately, almost paranoid. I try to explain, "Well..."
Dr. Szozas leans forward, listening intently as I talk about how I have had trouble sleeping, and waking up at odd times, and sometimes not being able to remember things from one moment to the next. I also mention that I find myself obsessing about certain topics or people, and the more time passes, the harder it becomes to stop thinking about them. He nods along with me, occasionally asking questions, such as, "Have you noticed any changes in your mood? Do you feel depressed? Angry? Sad?"
When I finish, I look at him expectantly, waiting for an answer.
But he doesn't seem to be responding. Instead, he gets up from his chair, and goes to the bookshelf behind his desk; I hear papers rustling. After a few seconds, he returns with a thick book that I recognize at once; the cover features a painting of a woman with long flowing hair, wearing a loose white gown.
The title reads: A Woman's Journey Through Life.
The doctor hands the book to me, and I open the cover. Inside are hundreds of pages, each containing an essay written by the author, Dr. Michael Szozas himself.
The first page is titled: 'The Anatomy of a Normal Mind

My name is Elizabeth Jane Smith." My heart beats faster, and I feel myself getting hot under the collar, and I can't believe that this doctor wants to know all about me.
He nods, "And?"
Oh God, what do I say? This isn't easy. The last time I saw a shrink was almost twenty years ago. It wasn't good then, and it won't be any better now. I sigh deeply, "Well..."
A few seconds pass before Dr. Szozas speaks again, "It's alright to tell me whatever you want to tell me, Liz. You don't have to worry about confidentiality."
God bless this guy. I nod, and begin to speak, "OK... I guess the short version would be that I've been feeling really weird lately. Like I'm losing control of things, and I keep thinking that there are people watching me. And they're laughing at me."
Dr. Szozas sits back, "Liz, you are not alone. People think about strange things sometimes. Sometimes we just need help figuring out what is real and what isn't. Is there anything else that might be bothering you?"
I shake my head slowly, "No, I guess I'm fine. I'll probably be leaving soon anyway, so I should get to it."
"Alrighty, then I will review our file and give you an assessment. If you'd be willing to fill out the intake form, I can start that process right away."
I smile at the thought, I'm always happy to do paperwork. I pick up the clipboard sitting on the coffee table, and I flip through the pages until I find the one I'm looking for. I read the questions aloud, "'What is the most important thing about me?' What is the first thing I notice about other people?'"
Szozas smiles gently at me, "The first thing I notice about you is that you are

My name is Elizabeth."   And then I pause again, because this is where it gets strange...or maybe just weird.
Dr. Szozas looks at me quizzically, and asks, "Elizabeth?"
I nod yes, and say, "Yes, sir."
He laughs softly, "That's funny, but okay..." And then he sits back, and folds his hands together on top of his lap.  He glances at me, and continues, "So tell me more about Elizabeth. What do you think is happening? How long have you been feeling this way?"
I feel myself blushing, which makes me even more uncomfortable. I stammer, "Uh, well...it started after I had a panic attack while watching TV last week. I was fine until I saw something scary on TV, and when I turned off the television, I felt awful. I thought I might die or go crazy, and I couldn't breathe right. It was horrible. I've never experienced anything like that before. Afterward, I tried to watch the news, but it didn't help; I still felt terrible. When I went home that night, I threw up twice, and passed out once. The next day I woke up with a headache, and I couldn't get to sleep at all; I stayed awake the whole time. I kept thinking about that episode I watched the other day, and I found that I couldn't stop thinking about that either; I would start to drift off, but I'd wake up a few hours later with the same thoughts running through my head. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but I'm really worried. That's why I'm here."
Dr. Szozas nods, "You said that you've never experienced a panic attack before; I assume that means that they happen very rarely, correct?"
"Oh yes, definitely!"
"Do you know if anyone else has ever suffered

My name is Laura Hartwick."
He nods, and then asks, "And why have you come?"
I pause again, thinking this through, trying to figure out what to say next. "Well, I think maybe I need help... I don't know why, but I feel very uneasy lately. Like something isn't right. And I just can't shake it off."
Dr. Szozas smiles, "What do you mean 'uncomfortable'? What sort of feelings? Do they stem from work or home life? Are there any problems at school?"
I tell him about the weird dreams, and how I've been having trouble sleeping, and feeling restless. He listens intently to all I say, and offers encouragement when appropriate. When I finish, he looks at me thoughtfully, "Do you remember anything specific about these dreams?"
I recall them vividly, although I try not to show too much emotion, "Yes, I dream about being chased by something terrible, with teeth..."
Dr. Szozas leans forward, his face serious, "Laura, what exactly does that mean to you?"
I swallow hard, I'd rather not talk about the details; it makes me feel dirty somehow, but I decide to answer anyway, and I begin to speak slowly and clearly, "It's like I'm running away from a predator that is chasing me, but I can't seem to escape its clutches. The only way I'm able to get free is to wake up."
Dr. Szozas gives me a moment to collect myself, and then he continues, "Is that enough information to go on? Can you give me more context?"
I shrug, I wish I had a better explanation, but I'm at a loss, I'm sorry.
"Would you like to share the rest with me, Laura?"
Oh god, I don't want to, but I need to. I nod, I open

My name is Lauren." And then I pause again, unsure if I should tell this stranger anything more. The only other person I've ever confided in was my best friend, Lisa, but she doesn't know much about me... or maybe she does, and I just don't want her to think less of me? Or perhaps I really do need help, and I'm hoping that Dr. Szazas can give me something that will put all my problems to rest. Whatever the case may be, I have to say something. "Well, I guess I'd better start somewhere..." I begin, trying to sound casual, but there is a quaver in my voice.
Dr. Szazas nods encouragingly, "That would be fine."
So I continue, "I'm a 25 year old woman living alone. I live near campus, and work part time at a coffee shop downtown. My friends call me 'Lauren', because that's what I go by most of the time. But they also call me 'Lolly'. That's short for Lollipop, which is a nickname I got when we were kids."
He listens intently to my words, nodding along with each one. His face shows nothing but interest, no judgment or criticism whatsoever. He simply wants to hear me out. I feel reassured.
"Anyway, I went through puberty early, and I'm still very self-conscious about it. I was the smallest girl in my class until I hit high school, but I was the tallest girl in the senior class. I had braces, too, but I stopped wearing them after I graduated from middle school. I was always embarrassed about having a small chest; I didn't even try to wear clothes that showed off my body; I wore baggy shirts, or loose-fitting pants. I was a skinny little thing; I never ate right; I was a healthy weight, but I was a bit chubby, I suppose.

My name is Eileen, and..."
He cuts me off, smiling broadly, "Eileen?"
Oh shit, what did I say? Did I just tell this guy my real name? What does he know about me? Oh God...
"Yes, sir."
He grins again, "You can call me Mike."
I smile back, "Ok, Mike. Why are you here today?"
Mike chuckles, "Well, let's start by talking about you. Tell me what brought you to our clinic?"
I think for a moment before answering, "It's hard to put into words."
He nods encouragingly, "Try anyway."
So I do. My story is pretty simple: I'm 23 years old, and I've been having problems since I was 15. The symptoms were mild enough then; I would have episodes where I'd get depressed or anxious. It was always fleeting, and I wasn't sure if they had anything to do with my bipolar disorder. I never sought treatment for them, because I didn't want anyone to find out about my condition.
As time went on, the depression got worse, until I couldn't function anymore. When I finally saw a doctor, I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, and I started taking medication. This helped somewhat, but I still felt like I was stuck in a rut, unable to move forward with any sort of life. I guess I should be thankful that I don't experience the worst parts of the disease, but I also feel that I'm missing out on something important and worthwhile.
I look at Mike, "What about me? How am I doing?"
"That's a good question. Let me ask one first. Do you consider yourself to be a 'normal' person?"
I shrug, "I suppose I am. I am an average college student, working part-time jobs, living a relatively normal lifestyle. I go to school
