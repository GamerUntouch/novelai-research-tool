=== Prompt ========================================
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "

=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Caitlin Watson."
He nods, acknowledging this fact, then asks, "And why have you decided to seek counseling?"
This question throws me off guard, and I stutter, "Well, um... because I've been having trouble sleeping lately..." My face grows hot as I try to explain further, "...and I keep dreaming all sorts of weird things. And I don't know what they mean, but they seem important somehow..."
Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding along with me as I continue talking. When I finish, he says simply, "Thank you Caitlin. That will do nicely. We can begin now if you'd like."
I nod, feeling slightly embarrassed by my lack of confidence earlier, "Yes please, sir."
Dr. Szozas chuckles softly, "No need to call me 'sir'. Just call me Mike. Now, I'll want to ask a few questions, just to get us started." He pauses, giving me time to answer any questions that may arise during our session together. "How old are you? What grade were you in last year? Do you live alone or with anyone else? How long have you lived there? Is it a new house, an older one? Are you married?"
Each question is answered briefly, and I feel more relaxed once I am done answering them; I am starting to realize that I am not crazy after all. I'm not sure whether I should be relieved, but I am a little disappointed that I am not the only person with such strange dreams. I'm also a bit annoyed that I didn't think to look up a psychiatrist before I went to the web; I am not used to dealing with doctors, but I suppose I'll get better at it eventually.
After I'm finished, Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair, crossing his legs and looking at me thoughtfully. I'm about to speak when he

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Caitlin Murphy."
He nods, encouragingly, "And why are you here?"
It suddenly hits me: this man knows nothing about what happened last night. What if something goes wrong? No, I can't let that happen. I have to tell him everything, or at least give him enough information to get started. "Last week, after we had dinner together, I went home and downloaded all the data files I'd been working on since college. That included things like my research notes, which were mostly related to artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. My notes also contained personal details about myself, including emails, online activity, phone calls... stuff like that. I was trying to decide whether or not I should upload them to the cloud, because I thought they might contain sensitive information that I didn't want anyone else to know about..." I pause, swallowing hard, "...but then I realized that I don't really care what other people think about me anymore. And I've decided to delete those files from my computer now, rather than wait until I die. It's just a matter of time before the world ends anyway, right?"
Dr. Szozas raises an eyebrow, "You seem very calm about the fact that the entire human race will soon cease to exist."
"Yeah, well I'm not exactly thrilled about it either, but I'm sure there are a lot more important issues to deal with first. Like figuring out how to live without computers, cell phones, electricity, etcetera."
He smiles again, "Do you feel that the end of the world is imminent?"
"Well, I guess I'll find out when I wake up tomorrow morning, won't I?"
"Yes, that is a good way to phrase it. But if I may ask, do you believe that the future is set in stone, that you cannot change anything that has already occurred? Or is the future fluid, subject to change?"

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Caitlin Watson." And then I pause again, because this is difficult for me to say: "...and I'm here because I think there may have been something wrong with me all along..."
He nods, and leans forward in his chair. I continue, "It started after my mom died...when I was nine years old." I feel myself begin to choke up, and I clear my throat before continuing, "She had cancer. It was very bad. She fought hard, she didn't want anyone else to know what was happening, but finally her doctor found out, and they did surgery to remove the tumor. But it wasn't enough to save her. A few weeks later we were notified by the hospital that she'd passed away."
Dr. Szozas looks at me sympathetically, "That must have been devastating for you, young lady."
"Yes, yes it was. My dad took care of us, but he was never really strong, and I guess I needed more than just his strength to get through that time. So I went back to school. I became a science nerd, and I excelled at math and physics. When I graduated high school, I got accepted into MIT. I wanted to become a physicist, but I realized I also loved psychology; I decided I would study both, and eventually go work in the field."
"And now?" asks Dr. Szozas, leaning back in his chair.
"Well, I'm not sure I'm cut out for being a psychologist. I've thought about going back to college, but I don't know if I can handle the stress of getting a degree right now; I'm not sure I'll be able to concentrate. I'm still working on finishing up my undergrad degree, and I'm thinking about doing a post-graduate certificate program, but I'm having a lot of trouble deciding which one to do."
"Caitlin, I understand how

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Caitlin Myers." I pause, then continue, "And I believe that there might be something wrong with me."
He nods, and leans back in his chair, crossing one leg over the other knee. He stares at me again, this time with more intensity than before. It makes me feel self-conscious, and I wonder if perhaps he can tell what I am thinking just by staring at me. I try not to fidget under his gaze, which feels somehow invasive, although it also relaxes me somewhat. Finally, after several long seconds have passed, he asks, "How do you know?"
"Know? Know what?"
"That there might be something wrong with you," he repeats patiently.
"Well, um... I've been having dreams lately..." I begin hesitantly.
Dr. Szozas cuts me off mid-sentence. "Caitlin, please don't beat around the bush. Tell me exactly what you think is happening with you."
So I explain to him that I had a dream last night where I was walking along a beach, when suddenly I felt myself sinking into the sand beneath my feet, and I couldn't get out. I tried to run away, but I kept falling deeper. I woke up, terrified, and I couldn't stop shaking.
He listens intently to me until I finish speaking, "Thank you, Caitlin, that will be all for today. You may go now. Please return next Monday at 9am. Thank you."
As I stand up to leave his office, I realize that I am trembling uncontrollably. I want to cry, but I'm not sure if I should be crying or laughing. I walk to the door slowly, trying to compose myself, and I turn the knob to open the door to the hallway. I'm still quivering, but I manage to say "thank you" to the receptionist who smiles at me with a

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Caitlin."
He nods slowly, waiting patiently. "Caitlin ... ?"
And then I realize something: this guy knows my name already! And there is nothing I can do about it right now, except tell him what happened, and hope that he will understand. But before I get too far along, I feel compelled to ask him, "How did you know my name? It isn't in any of our records."
He smiles again, and his face brightens even more, "Oh yes, it is. When we were emailing back and forth, I asked if you would mind telling me your full name, just to confirm that we had properly connected. You said 'Hi Michael,' and then you gave your name. That was enough for me to figure out that we'd been communicating somehow. I wasn't expecting it though; I didn't think anyone used real names anymore. This was a fun surprise!"
There's something about the way he talks that makes me want to trust him, and I relax into the cushions of the couch. "OK... uhm..." I begin hesitantly, "...well, I guess that explains how you knew my name. I'm not sure what else you need to hear, but I'll try to explain things the best I can."
"That sounds good to me," he responds cheerfully.
So I start talking about everything that I have experienced since I woke up, and I don't hold anything back. I've never talked about this stuff with anybody; I don't really understand why I am doing it now, but I keep thinking that maybe I should talk about it with somebody who understands the situation better than I do. I explain that I am not crazy, that I am aware that I am having experiences that are beyond the normal range of human experience. I describe the strange sensations that I sometimes experience, such as the feeling that I am being watched, or the feelings

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Caitlin Smith."
He nods, and asks, "And why have you sought my counsel?"
"Well... I've been feeling different lately, sort of weird. And then I came across this website called 'Weird Science', and they had a whole section on people who were experiencing similar things to me, and..." I trail off, unsure if I should continue.
"Yes? You want to know more about those others?"
I nod.
"Go ahead, please tell me what happened after you clicked onto their site."
So I do. I describe my experience with the Internet, with finding WeirdScience.com, reading through the archives, and finally coming across the story about Michael Szoszas, which led me to emailing him. My explanation is short, but clear. When I finish talking, I wait for his reaction, hoping that I didn't say anything wrong or inappropriate.
Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair, folds his hands together, and smiles at me. "You are very brave to come here today, Ms. Smith. I'm not sure if you are aware of this, but we can discuss the details of your case later, when I get a better sense of where you are at right now. But I am happy to hear that you are seeking help. I think you are doing the right thing by contacting me."
I smile, relieved that I did the right thing. I hope that I don't disappoint the doctor. I stand up, and I walk to the door, but before I leave I turn to face the psychiatrist again. He looks up at me with a warm smile, and I ask, "Is there any way that I could pay you for your time?"
He laughs at that, and shakes his head. He stands up from his chair, and walks around his desk to me. He reaches out his hand to me, and I take it, his grip is

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Caitlin O'Hare." I pause for effect, and then add, "And this is my story."
He nods, and leans back in his chair. The silence stretches between us for several minutes, until finally he asks, "Would you mind telling me what brought you to our office?"
So I start talking, and tell him all about it: the web, the headaches, the anxiety attacks, the panic attacks, the depression, the suicidal ideation...
When I finish, he looks thoughtful for a moment, before saying, "Caitlin, do you have any family? Anyone we can contact?"
At first I think he means relatives, or perhaps friends, but after thinking about it for a second, I realize that he means people whom I know. And I don't. I shake my head, "No, not really..."
"Do you live alone?"
Again I shake my head. "No, I share an apartment with two other girls."
"Is there anyone else that might be able to help you, a friend, relative, colleague, roommate, girlfriend? Someone who knows you well enough that they would be willing to act as a sounding board, or even a counselor?"
I'm confused by the question. I hadn't thought about having a friend to talk to about it; I've never had a real close relationship with another person, except maybe a few girlfriends. But now that I'm actually sitting across from a psychiatrist, I'm wondering if I should bring up the idea of confiding in a friend.
Then I remember something that I read online. It said that I need to get a therapist, preferably a female one. I wonder if I should mention that to Dr. Szozas.
Finally, I decide that I'll wait to see how things go.
After a short time, I ask, "What does a typical day look like for a doctor such as myself, when

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Caitlin Murphy." And then I pause again, because this is where things get weird. Because I have absolutely nothing else to say. My mind goes blank, and all thoughts leave me as I stare off into space, wondering what the hell is wrong with me? Is there something seriously wrong with me? Am I losing my marbles? Why did I think that I needed to consult a doctor? But wait... if I don't know anything about myself, then how can I go ahead and do any sort of therapy? It doesn't seem right. I should just shut up now. What would he want me to talk about anyway? Would he ask me questions about my childhood or something? No, probably not. Maybe he'd ask me about my family. How does one even begin to describe their parents to a stranger? They were both pretty normal people, if a little strange, and they had been married for a long time before divorcing when I was seven years old. Mom remarried about two years later, which didn't work out too well either, and Dad ended up marrying a woman named Susan about ten years ago. She moved us to Oregon after that. I've only seen her twice since we left Pennsylvania.
No, I guess I need to start talking about school. I went to high school with a girl named Emma, who is also a computer science major at MIT, but she transferred to Stanford last year to pursue a Phd. I'm sure that I'll run into her at the reunion next month.
So I tell him about college, about being an engineer at Intel, about the company parties and the friends I made there. I mention the guy I dated for a while back home, a software developer who lives in Portland. I'm sure that I shouldn't be telling him about that; I'm afraid that I might be opening up a whole new can of worms, but I feel that I owe it to Dr. Szoz

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Caitlin Smith." I pause again, waiting for him to say something. But he just stares at me, unblinking. My heart beats faster, and I feel myself blushing slightly. "Why did I come here?" I ask.
He smiles, and sits back in the chair, "Well, Caitlin, let's start by talking about what brought you to this office today."
I sigh inwardly, realizing that I have no idea where we should begin. We talk about my job, and my life, and then he asks me questions about my relationship with my parents, and my sister, and my friends. It feels good to finally get all those things off my chest. The whole time I'm telling him everything, I'm thinking to myself, 'This is not weird.' Why would I think it was? This isn't creepy or anything. And yet there I am, explaining to this nice guy that I've never met before, about my family issues. He nods along with everything I'm saying, and then after a few minutes I realize that he hasn't said much of anything himself.
Finally, I break the silence: "So...is this normal?" I ask, feeling a little embarrassed now that I've gotten to the point where I can't help but wonder if I am being too personal with the doctor.
Dr. Szozas laughs a hearty laugh, and I relax a bit more when I hear that sound. "Caitlin, I don't know if I'd call what we are doing right now normal, but I do know that I am very interested in hearing about your situation, and I promise that I will be completely honest with you."
We continue our conversation until I am done with my story, and I am starting to feel a lot better. I thank Dr. Szozas for his help, and I leave his office with a smile on my face. I walk out into the hallway,

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Caitlin Smith." I pause again, wondering if there is anything else I should say... maybe something more personal? But then I realize this isn't a date, just a doctor talking to another patient. So I continue: "Well, uh, I have been having trouble sleeping lately, and I've also noticed that I seem to be getting angry very easily lately..." I trail off, waiting for his reaction.
He nods, "Yes, sleep disturbance can indicate a number of different things, depending on its severity. Do you feel tired during the day?"
"No, actually I don't really feel sleepy until late afternoon or evening. It's hard to explain, because I used to get sleepy all the time, but now I'm waking up feeling alert and refreshed. The only problem is that I still wake up several times throughout the night. And I think that I'm starting to lose control over myself when I do. Maybe I shouldn't tell you this, but sometimes I even find myself screaming at people without meaning too." I stop to gather my thoughts; I am embarrassed by what I'm saying.
Dr. Szozas is smiling at me encouragingly; "It sounds to me like you might be experiencing a mild form of insomnia. Tell me about the anger issues -- are they directed at anyone specific?"
"Uh, yes, well I guess I would say that I am becoming increasingly frustrated with the way that the world works right now, especially the lack of progress made in the field of AI research. I think that I am losing faith that we will ever be able to create a machine that is truly sentient, that is capable of understanding the concepts that humans understand. I know that I am being overly pessimistic, but I am beginning to wonder if I am the only one who feels that way. I am afraid that I am going to go insane if I keep dwelling on the subject. I want to believe that I am wrong, but I
