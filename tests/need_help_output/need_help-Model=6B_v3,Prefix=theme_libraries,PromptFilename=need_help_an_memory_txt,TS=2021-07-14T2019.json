He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",

You seem very worried. Are you concerned that you may become impotent? Or perhaps there is something else?\"\nI shake my head, \"No...it's not that I can't get hard anymore, it's more like I want to cum a lot, but then I stop myself before I even get close. It feels bad when I jerk off and I try to hold back, and I end up coming a few times before I finally give up and let go. But I don't think I'm losing my erection; I still climax pretty easily when I touch my penis.

  "prompt": "I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",
  "result": "My name is Irene Winters, and I've been having trouble sleeping lately.\"\nHe nods, and smiles again, \"Yes, let's get right to business. Tell me about this problem?\"\nSo I tell him, and he listens intently as I describe what I've experienced. And then we talk more, and I learn more about him, and about his work. It turns out that he specializes in treating people suffering from sleep disorders, insomnia, and other similar issues. \nThen he asks, \"Have you tried any medications? Have you had any recent life changes or stressful events?\" I shake my head 'no'.\nAfter a few minutes, he stands up and begins walking back to his chair. He sits down and looks at me, \"Well, I think that you have a serious condition, but I can't diagnose without examining you. I'll need to run a couple tests on you, and I'd like to do a little testing while I'm at it. Can I trust you not to move during the exam?\"\nI nod my head.\nHe continues, \"I need to ask a lot of personal questions, but I promise I won't use the results against you. If I find anything unusual, I will contact the appropriate authorities, and they may request further information. But I don't want to scare you, I just need a bit of help. So I need to know if I can trust you, and if I can, I'm going to proceed. Do you understand?\"\nI feel a bit nervous, but I also feel reassured by his presence and his smile. I nod my head.\n\"Good girl. Now, I'm not a doctor, and I'm certainly not a psychologist. I am a psychiatrist though, and I specialize in unusual cases like yours. I'm trained to be sensitive to subtle clues and cues. I'm very good at reading nonverbal behavior; I can tell if a person is lying simply",
