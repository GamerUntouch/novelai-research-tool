=== Prompt ========================================
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "

=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Hachikuji."
"Hachikuj─"
"It means 'the broken bridge.'"
"Oh? A fitting moniker, then. But please, continue," he prompts.
So I start talking: about my life since coming to this town (which isn't much), and about being bullied by Senjogahara... And after hearing all about me, he asks questions too, and listens intently. It feels good to talk about myself to someone else, even if they are just listening. When I finish, we both have our hands clasped together.
Then Dr. Szozas stands up again, and starts walking back and forth across his room. The movement gives the impression that he is deep in thought, pondering something, but really it's probably because he wants to stretch his legs out.
He stops before a cabinet, opens its doors, and pulls out a bottle of water. After taking a swig, he returns to where I'm seated, "How do you feel?"
"Um..."
"Do you think things are better now than when you came to me?"
"...Yeah, I guess so."
"And what about the bullying?"
"Well, I've been thinking about that a lot recently, but I don't know if I can say anything about that yet... I'd rather not bring up that subject right away."
"That makes sense. What about the other issues that brought you here today, though? Do you still want to discuss those?"
"Sure, if that would help."
Dr. Szozas sits down next to me, facing me, and the two of us hold hands. I get the feeling that the doctor is trying to be considerate, but I also get the sense that he is a little awkward about it. He is a very kind man, but I doubt that he is used to holding hands with a girl.
But I am

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Araragi Koyomi."
He nods, then looks back at his computer screen, which displays a blank white page, "And why are you here?"
What do I say? What can I even tell this guy? It feels too personal...but I don't know what else to talk about.
"...Because I have problems..."
"Yes, yes, please go ahead."
So I start talking, telling him all about myself. About being bullied by Senjogahara. About coming home after school one day and finding her there with Hanekawa. And also about meeting Hachikuji. As I speak, I feel more relaxed than before, perhaps because he doesn't seem hostile or angry at any point. I think he's actually listening intently to me, rather than just nodding along.
It felt good to get it off my chest. Now I'm feeling better, I continue. "Afterward, she started acting strangely. She'd always been weird, but now she seemed different somehow. Like something had changed inside her─she was never a bad person to begin with, but she would suddenly snap at me without warning. I couldn't understand what was wrong. I thought maybe I should report it to the police, but I didn't want to get involved with them if I didn't need to, and I didn't really believe that they would listen to a middle-schooler anyway. So I decided to try counseling instead."
"Counseling," he repeats.
"Yeah, I figured I might as well consult a doctor about it. I've tried seeing a few doctors since I transferred to a new high school, but I haven't found anyone who I liked the way I did with Dr. Szozas. He wasn't the kind of doctor I expected, but he made me feel at ease right away. I guess that goes to show that people are all individuals."
"Indeed. I

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Araragi Senjogahara."
He nods. "And why have you come?"
"Well..."
"Why do you want to talk to me? Do you need help?"
"Yes...no, maybe."
"...You don't know what to ask, then. You've come to me because you feel lost, right?"
"Yeah, something along those lines."
"So let me get straight to the point: What exactly are you feeling lost about?"
What indeed. This is a very good question.
But there isn't any answer to this question. There aren't any words to describe it.
It feels like I can say anything, and I'd still only be describing myself. The best I can manage is an analogy. A person who gets their feelings hurt by others, or who hurts themselves physically or mentally through self-destructive behavior, would probably call themselves "lost". But that doesn't really tell me much. It just describes them, not what they are feeling.
The fact remains that I am feeling lost.
I am unable to find meaning in life. And it is making me miserable.
That is all I know.
"All right," he says after a momentary pause. "Let's start with the basics. Let me ask you a few questions. How old are you, Senjogahara?"
"Twenty-two years old."
"Have you been to college before, or are you a high school graduate?"
"College, yes."
"Are you currently enrolled in a university somewhere?"
"No, I dropped out last year."
"Oh? Why did you drop out?"
"I was too busy with other things."
"Other things, huh...? Like what kind of 'other things'?"
"Work, mostly. I had a part-time job at a convenience store, but I quit that when I started going

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Araragi Hachikuji." I say this because I don't know what else to call myself. If I were to give my real name, I would have been asked by now. "And I've come to consult with you, Doctor."
He nods and looks back at me, "You mentioned that you had 'some trouble.' What sort of troubles?"
"Well...it's hard to explain..."
"Try anyway."
"Um... Well, there's something happening inside my body that makes me feel strange."
"...What do you mean? Is there any pain or discomfort?"
"No, nothing like that. It just feels weird. Like I'm not human anymore."
"Not human?"
"Yes. But I think maybe that's normal. Maybe I'm supposed to be feeling that way right now."
"Maybe you are," he agrees. "But what exactly is making you feel that way?"
"That's the problem─"
"Then we'll begin with the beginning. Tell me, please, about your life until yesterday. How old are you now?"
"Uhm... I'm sixteen years old. Yesterday was my birthday."
"Ah, yes, I remember now. Happy Birthday. I hope you get a lot of presents today."
"Thank you. I did. I got a bunch of things from everyone. My family, friends, classmates, teachers... I even got a present from a girl I went to middle school with, who I haven't seen since then. She sent me a message on LINE saying she'd send me a gift if I ever needed one, but I never thought I'd need it, but when I saw the package I couldn't help but open it up."
"Aha. I see. And the contents?"
"It was an outfit I wore when I played basketball in elementary school. I didn't wear it very often, but I

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Hachikuji. I've been having trouble sleeping recently."
"Ah yes, insomnia. What do you think caused this?" he asks, placing one finger against his temple and leaning back in his chair.
"Well... I don't know..." I reply honestly, "It started after I found out that I had killed somebody. I can't remember what happened, but I seem to have lost control somehow."
"Hmhm, hmm. Tell me more about this incident. How did you kill them? By stabbing them with a knife or by strangling them with your bare hands? Were they still alive when you stabbed them? Or were they already dead? Could you feel their death throes? Did you hear any screams?"
He's asking all sorts of questions, and he seems to be waiting patiently for my answers. The fact that he is taking notes with such intensity makes me wonder if there's a recorder running somewhere nearby. I nod along with each question, not sure where he wants to go with his line of questioning.
"You said that you heard nothing before killing them. Was the killer present during the murder scene itself? If so, was anyone else involved in the crime? And finally, did the murderer act alone, or was the perpetrator part of a group that helped the criminal cover up the crime?"
"I'm sorry, I'm just trying to answer as many questions as possible. I'm a little confused myself right now..."
Dr. Szozas nods, "That is perfectly understandable. We'll get to the bottom of everything eventually. It will be better to start at the beginning, though."
So I tell him about the date I went to with Araragi-senpai and Oshino, about the fight we got into afterward, about the strange phenomenon that occurred afterwards. I also explain about the web and the dream I saw, and I ask him about the psychiatrist who is supposed to

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Hachikuji...and I'm here because I have something important to tell you."
"...And what would that be?"
"Um..."
He tilts his head slightly, waiting for me to continue. I'm feeling more and more uncomfortable by the second, but this guy doesn't seem like he'll yell at me or anything. And besides, I feel like I can trust him.
"Um...well, um..."
It's hard to get started. It feels strange just talking normally to another person after all these years. But I need to say something before I lose courage entirely.
"Uh...I think I may be cursed or something."
"Cursed? What do you mean by 'cursed?'"
"Well...um...it might sound crazy, but ever since I became a ghost, I've been getting really sick lately. I don't know if I'm being punished or what, but I keep having stomachaches and stuff, and I get dizzy too often now."
"Hmm...so, you believe that there is a curse placed on you?"
"Yeah, maybe..."
Dr. Szozas nods his head slowly. "You mentioned that you were a ghost, but did you also mention that you are a human girl?"
"Huh?"
"Are you a human girl?"
"Yes...but I'm not sure how to explain that to you."
"Try to put aside any preconceived notions about ghosts and spirits and things like that. Ghosts are a type of spirit that is not bound to the laws of the world. That is to say, they are free to come and go at will, and they are able to possess objects without leaving a trace behind. They are not tied to the rules that govern the living, and that includes the physical body that houses them. So, I ask again, are you a human girl?"
"Y-yes, I am.

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Hachikuji."
"Hm? Oh, right... Yes, I've heard all about you. You were quite famous before coming here today," he states offhandedly, which makes me feel a little embarrassed. But then again, maybe this isn't such a bad thing after all.
"Famous?"
"Yes, you know. The girl who got lost while searching for her friends. A lot happened back then, didn't they?"
"...Yeah..."
"And now you have another problem. Let me guess: Your friend Kanbaru has been causing trouble for you lately too?"
"She─yes."
"Hmm. Well, let's start by getting to know each other better. What do you do when you get home from school?"
"Huh?"
He asks this question with a gentle smile. He doesn't seem to expect a reply, just wants to talk.
It feels awkward to answer, but I don't want to leave things unsaid either. "Well, um... I go shopping with Oshino, sometimes we hang out with Miss Gaen, and we always eat lunch together. We also play games when we can find time to do that."
"Games, huh...? Hmm. I see."
What does he see? I wonder if he sees something else entirely.
"Do you often meet with your classmates outside the classroom?"
"Uhuh. I usually run into them at the station or at the library or at the bookstore or at the arcade or at the park or at the shrine or at the supermarket or at the hospital or at the cram school or at the police box or at the coffee shop or at the gymnasium or at the pool or at the swimming club or at the zoo or at the aquarium or at the festival or at the fireworks show or at the baseball field or at the amusement park or at the public bathhouse or at the shrine or at the shrine

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Araragi Koyomi."
"Koyomi...?" asks Dr. Szozas, tilting his head slightly, "Hmm..."
"Oh yes, um, Koyominatori? No, just Koyomi."
"That's fine, I'll call you by whatever you prefer, then. What brings you to see me today, Koyomi?"
"Well, uh... It started off as a simple case of depression. But recently, I've been experiencing weird thoughts─and feelings that don't seem right, they're not normal. Like, I can't sleep because I have dreams where I kill people, or I feel like I'm being pursued by something evil, and there are moments when I think I might be possessed. And also, I haven't heard back from anyone since I emailed them. My parents aren't answering either, and I'm starting to get worried about what this means."
Dr. Szozas looks at me curiously, "Your parents... Aren't answering?"
"Yes, they won't answer their phone, and they said they'd come visit me if I called. They know about my condition, apparently, but still..."
"And you haven't received a reply to your email?"
"No, nothing yet. I sent it yesterday afternoon."
"Yesterday afternoon, huh. You were probably sleeping when you did that, weren't you? I suppose that explains why you didn't receive an automatic acknowledgement. Ah well, I guess that makes sense. If you're having trouble falling asleep, try taking a nap before sending an email. That should help you relax enough to compose a good message."
"Huh? A-A-Are you saying I need to take a nap?!"
"Well, I wouldn't say that exactly. I meant that a short rest will do you good. How about you go home and take a bath, wash away the stress of the

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Hanekawa Kyousuke Nadeko Sengoku."
He nods, and then asks, "And why did you want to meet with me?"
This question throws me off guard. Why do I need to tell him? Am I being investigated by the police or something?
But...he just said that we were meeting because I asked him to. If anything, I should ask him this: what does he think of me?
So I decide to answer honestly. "Because I wanted to talk to you about myself. About how I've been feeling lately..."
As soon as I finish speaking, he raises an eyebrow at me. "...Hanekawa? What about you?"
"...Ohhh~ I don't know anymore. It feels like there's nothing left inside of me."
For the next ten minutes or so, Dr. Szozas listens intently to my story. He asks questions, and I answer them, occasionally prompting me to clarify things when they aren't clear enough. And after hearing all about my life up until now, he leans back in his chair and looks at me with a critical gaze.
"Well, I'll admit that you have quite the unique personality. You seem to be a very bright girl, but also a little troubled. In fact, I'd say that the only reason you can function at school is due to your strong will─and that might be a problem if you weren't such a good student, too."
"Huh?"
It was a simple comment, but I couldn't help but be surprised at his words. I thought that I was doing a pretty decent job at school. I was even the vice president of the Student Council!
In that case, I was shocked. I was stunned that I was actually considered a "good student" despite my behavior.
"You see, I believe that the cause of your problems is that you're trying to hide who you really

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Hanekawa Tsubasa."
"And?"
"...Hanekawa...Tsubasa..."
"'Neko,' huh? 'Pochi.' That's cute. What's wrong with you, Pochi? You don't have any friends? Or maybe you just haven't met them yet?"
"No, um─I do have friends. But I've been having trouble making new ones lately."
"Why is that?"
"Because they all think I'm weird. They say things like, 'You know, Hanekawa isn't really normal.'"
"That sounds like something you'd hear from your classmates at school."
"Yes, exactly. And then they start avoiding me. It hurts when people avoid you, doesn't it?"
"Well, yeah. People should try to get along with one another. The world would be a better place if everyone did their best to live together peacefully."
Dr. Szozas nods emphatically.
He's nodding because he agrees with me, I suppose.
But it feels a little strange to be talking about peace with this guy. I'm not sure what to do with myself. This is where we need to talk about the issue at hand, but I can't seem to find the words to express it.
So I ask a question instead, "Um, Doctor, are you a psychiatrist?"
"Of course I am," he answers without hesitation. "Though I prefer to call myself a counselor. I believe there are many different kinds of psychiatrists out there, but I specialize in unusual cases. I also work with children."
"Children?" I repeat back to him. "Do you treat kids with issues too?"
"Ahaha! Well, I wouldn't go that far. I only deal with adults, but I do spend time with children sometimes. I even helped out with some counseling sessions at a daycare center once or twice. I
