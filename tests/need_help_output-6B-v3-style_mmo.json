   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Alice...or just Al.\"  He nods slowly, \"And why are you here?\"\nThat question stings. It feels like I've been asked something very personal by a total stranger, and I don't want to answer. But I have to say this, because if there is anyone who can help me understand myself better, it would be this doctor.\nSo I start off quietly, \"Well...\" I pause, then continue, \"...it started when I got back home from school yesterday. When I came home from class, I had to go through the usual ritual: changing clothes, brushing teeth, eating dinner, homework, etcetera. And then I went online to play World versus Wild. The game was already running, but I couldn't log in until after 7pm, when everyone else was asleep. As soon as I logged in, I felt like I'd hit a wall. Like I was stuck inside a bubble where time didn't exist anymore. Everything became slow motion, and I couldn't move forward or backward.\"\nDr. Szozas listens intently to me without saying anything. Finally I feel I've said enough, \"It wasn't a big deal at first; I thought maybe I should call a friend to come hang out with me. But I kept thinking about it all day long. I tried playing other games, but they were the same way. I couldn't get into them. I tried logging into the guild house, but I couldn't even do that right. I couldn't keep track of the time at all; I spent hours trying to figure out what the heck was going on. I wanted to talk to a friend about it, but I just couldn't find the words to explain it to her. I felt weird talking to a girl about it anyway, but I didn't know how to tell a guy. I'm not sure if I ever will be able to.\n\"But I figured out that I",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Kirito.\"\nHe nods, \"And why have you chosen to visit our clinic today?\"\nIt feels strange to tell this stranger my whole life story, but I do it anyway: \"Well...it's complicated...\"\nDr. Szozas smiles again, encouragingly, \"Just start talking, there's nothing wrong with that. You'll feel better after you've gotten all of it off your chest.\"\nSo I begin: \"When I was young, I used to play a lot of games online. And I got good at them. A friend invited me to join an elite guild called SAO. It was a game where people had swords and shields and fought monsters. But we were fighting each other instead of the monsters. We'd kill each other sometimes too. The more powerful players would win battles, and then they'd get stronger than us. That was what happened to me, actually. When I was just starting out, I was one of the best fighters in the world. No matter how many times I lost, or died, I always came back to try again. After a while, though, things changed. I started losing fights left and right. My skills weren't improving anymore. I couldn't keep up with the others, no matter how hard I tried. I kept dying, over and over. Finally, I realized that I wasn't getting any stronger at all, and that I was never going to be able to beat the strongest player. I didn't know what to do. I quit the game and stopped playing altogether.\n\"But I still wanted to be a top-tier gamer. So I looked up the most popular MMOs, hoping to find another game that I could enjoy. I found a few that seemed interesting, but none of them really grabbed me. I played a little bit of World of Warcraft, but I felt like I was wasting my time doing that when I should be working toward something else. I",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Kirito.\" The moment I say this, I feel my cheeks flush red with embarrassment. But I don't know why...it just feels wrong somehow. It sounds too formal, too serious, almost fake. My real name is Eugeo, which means \"kindly one,\" and I've always liked that better than \"Kirito\"...but now I have a strange feeling that I shouldn't use it anymore.\nBut then again, maybe this is all normal? Maybe there's nothing weird about it...?\nDr. Szozas listens quietly to what I tell him, nodding along occasionally. When I finish, he asks, \"So, do you think you can explain exactly what happened?\"\nWhat happens next surprises even myself. I start talking about Asuna, her sudden disappearance after our fight against Sinon, and the way she treated me afterward. About how I went back to school and learned about Aincrad's SAO system, and how I thought that perhaps we might be able to meet up once more. And finally, about the strange dream I had that morning, where I saw a girl with black hair named Alice, and heard her voice calling out to me.\nHe sits silently through the whole story, listening intently. His face shows no emotion at any point during the telling; his only reaction is the occasional blink or nod to indicate that I'm making sense.\nWhen I finish, I ask, \"Is that enough information to diagnose me with a mental illness or something?\"\nAt last, Dr. Szozas breaks his silence. \"Well, first, let me confirm that you are indeed 'you' from the other world. If you were to disappear suddenly into another dimension or realm, I would be concerned about the possibility of a temporal paradox...\"\n\"Oh, uh, I'm not sure I understand that part yet, but if that's the case, I'll be fine. I'm an Integrity Knight",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Kirito.\"\n\"Kirito...what does 'Ki' stand for?\" he asks softly, leaning forward slightly.\nI pause again, unsure what to say next. But then I realize something: this guy is really just being friendly and asking questions, nothing more sinister than that. And there is a lot that I don't know about myself yet, so perhaps it would be best if I answered all of his questions truthfully?\n\"It stands for Kirigaya Tomohiko,\" I reply slowly.\nHe nods, satisfied by that answer. He leans back in his chair, folds his hands together, and looks at me, saying, \"Tell me, what do you think about yourself right now?\"\nThat question is difficult to answer, because I have very little self-knowledge or confidence. My parents were divorced when I was young, and I never had much contact with them after that. They didn't want anything to do with me, and I grew up without any real friends. When I got older, I started working part-time jobs and went straight through school until high school graduation. The only time I ever felt truly happy was during those years when I played online games with other people. I've always been alone, but I can't remember a single moment where I wished that I wasn't.\nSo I look at the doctor and say, \"Well, I guess I'm pretty normal, I guess...\"\n\"Hmm...that's a good start,\" Dr. Szozas replies, nodding his head. \"Now tell me about your dreams. I understand that you are having nightmares about the Underworld, and that the dreams are getting worse. Do you feel that the dream is affecting your life at all?\"\nThis is a strange question; I hadn't thought about it before, but the last few days I haven't dreamed at all. I'm not sure if that's a sign that the nightmare is subsiding",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is... Ainsley.\"\nHe nods, and then looks back at me, \"And why have you come?\"\nThis question makes me feel uncomfortable, because I don't know how much information to give this doctor. My mother had said nothing more than that he was a specialist in unusual cases, which sounds very vague. It also doesn't explain what exactly I think is abnormal about myself. But I can tell from the way he asks that he wants to hear all the details. And that means I have to talk about it, even if I'm not sure where to start.\nSo I begin, \"Well, um...\"\n\"Ainsley? Can you speak up a little louder?\" He requests.\nOops. I try again, \"Um... yes sir. Well, when I was younger, I used to play video games online. I've been playing since before I turned ten years old, and I started logging into them when I was thirteen.\"\n\"Oh wow, that's amazing!\" he exclaims. \"How long do you play now, roughly?\"\n\"Since I hit eighteen.\"\n\"That is incredible! How many hours a day are we talking about there? Ten or fifteen?\"\n\"Fifteen to twenty-five.\"\nHe pauses, and I sense that I am being evaluated by this man, and that I should answer questions honestly. I continue with the story: \"But I got addicted to the game, and I began spending most of my free time playing it. I didn't go out with friends anymore; I just logged onto the internet, played, ate, slept. I didn't eat properly, I barely went to school, I hardly ever took care of anything else besides the game. I stopped going to the bathroom, I lost weight, I couldn't sleep, I was always tired. I wanted to be the best player I could be, but I wasn't getting any better. I thought that I",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Alice Zuberg.\"\nHe nods silently, waiting patiently.\n\"And...\"\n\"Yes?\" he asks gently.\n\"Um... Well, this might sound strange, but I've been experiencing something very weird lately. It started right after we beat ALO, and I feel like there's a hole inside of me, somewhere deep within my chest. Like if I try too hard, or push myself too far, I'll start screaming. And sometimes I get dizzy, and my vision gets blurry, and I have trouble breathing.\"\n\"Alice, do you know what anxiety disorder is? Do you suffer from one?\" he inquires calmly, and I nod.\n\"When you were talking about your panic attacks before, did you ever experience them while playing ALO?\"\n\"No, never had any problems with that game.\"\n\"How about MMOs generally? Have you ever experienced anything similar to what you described?\"\n\"Never.\"\n\"Are you aware that there are several different types of depression, ranging from mild to severe? Are you familiar with those terms?\"\n\"Uh, yes.\"\n\"Have you ever suffered from an eating disorder such as bulimia, or anorexia nervosa, or bingeing?\"\n\"Nope, not at all.\"\n\"Do you currently drink alcohol, use drugs, smoke cigarettes, engage in risky sexual behavior, abuse prescription medications, or are otherwise abusing substances?\"\n\"None of the above.\"\n\"So I'm going to ask again: are you suffering from a mental health condition that is causing the symptoms you describe?\"\n\"...No.\"\nDr. Szozas smiles at me, and I find that I can't help but smile back at him.\n\"That is good news to hear, Alice. I am glad to see that you are taking care of yourself.\"\nThe rest of the interview was pretty standard stuff, questions about family, job, hobbies,",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Kirito.\"\nHe nods slightly, \"And...why are you here?\"\nThis time I answer honestly, \"Because I can't sleep.\"\nSzozas smiles again, then leans back in his chair, folding his hands together atop his lap. \"Tell me more about this sleeplessness...\"\nIt took a while to get started, but once we got rolling, I found myself telling him all about Asuna, Yui, and even Rulitora. When I finished talking, he said nothing for several minutes, just staring off into space. Finally, he broke the silence by asking, \"So what do you think? What's causing this problem?\"\nAt first I didn't know where to begin, but after thinking about it for a moment, I decided to tell him the truth. \"Well, I've been having nightmares since before the beta test began.\"\nDr. Szozas gave a thoughtful nod, and asked, \"Do you remember any dreams during the beta test itself?\"\n\"No. But I had one nightmare right before I left SAO last night. It was about a girl named Agil, and she looked exactly like Asuna. She called me a fake gamer, and tried to kill me with a sword.\"\n\"Ah yes, that's quite a common dream theme. Do you recall anything else about the dream?\"\n\"Not really. The only thing I remember is that there were three other people watching the fight from the shadows, but they disappeared when I woke up.\"\n\"Hmm...so you don't have a clear memory of the events themselves. That is to be expected, given that the memories are still being reconstructed.\"\n\"Reconstructed...? Oh! You mean I might not be remembering the real things that happened, but rather the data that the game generated to represent them?\"\nThe doctor nodded.\n\"That makes sense, I guess. I'm sorry if I",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Kirito, and...well...\" I clear my throat, feeling very self conscious, \"It all started last night.\"\nHe listens attentively, waiting for me to continue, then finally asks, \"You went outside?\"\n\"Yeah. It was late, so I decided to go out walking, just to get away from home. And there were two men following me. They kept trying to talk to me, asking where I lived, what I did for work, stuff like that. When they saw that I wasn't interested in talking, one of them pulled something out--\"\n\"A knife? A gun? What sort of weapon was this?\"\n\"Oh, uh, it looked like a machete, or maybe a sword. The blade had a serrated edge, and it was pretty big.\"\nDr. Szozas nods slowly, and gestures to a chair across from us. I take a deep breath, \"When I tried to run away, they chased after me. There was another guy with them, wearing dark clothes. He ran up behind me and swung the machete at my back. I don't know if he meant to hit me or not; it cut right through my jacket and into my side.\"\n\"Did the pain hurt?\"\n\"...Yes. I screamed and fell to the ground. My assailant kicked me several times before running off. I got to my feet and staggered a few steps toward the forest, but I couldn't move any farther. I knew I needed to hide somewhere until the other man left the area, but I didn't have the strength to stand up again. I sat down under a tree to wait for the man to leave, but I passed out.\"\n\"And when you woke up, you found that you'd been stabbed, is that correct?\"\n\"That's about the size of it. I'm lucky I survived. I've already seen the wound myself, but the",
