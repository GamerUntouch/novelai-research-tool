=== Prompt ========================================
I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.

[Year: 2020 AD]
[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "


=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Amanda Kowalski. I've been seeing Dr. Szozas since last week. We have met twice already."
He smiles, "And what brings you here today?"
"Well... I'm having trouble sleeping..."
"Sleep? What do you mean by 'sleep?'"
"Um.. Well, I sleep really deeply, but then I wake up, and there's this feeling of dread that comes along with waking up. It feels like something bad happened during the night, and I can't remember anything about it."
Dr. Szozas nods thoughtfully, "That sounds like insomnia. Do you know if you have any other symptoms associated with it?"
I shake my head, "No. I don't think so."
"Do you feel tired or stressed most days, or maybe just on certain nights?"
I nod, "Yeah, I guess. But I always get a good amount of rest. I'm not exactly sure when I start getting anxious, I just do. I also seem to crave sugar, and I drink a lot of coffee. I eat a lot of carbs, and I'm not sure why. I'm not sure why I'm craving them, either. I'm not fat, I'm not skinny, I'm not overweight, I'm not underweight. I'm a healthy weight, I'm just eating too much, and I should probably cut back a little. I've tried cutting out all sorts of things, but I still end up eating more than I want to. I usually try to exercise regularly, and I work out a couple times a week, but I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I'm not sure why I'm having these feelings, or where they come from. I'm frustrated because I can't figure out a way to stop the cycle. I need help. Please, please, Dr. Szozas, tell me how to cure my insomnia!"
The

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Elizabeth Mccarthy, I'm 19 years old."
He nods, and asks, "And what brings you here today?"
I pause again, and then say, "Well, I've been having problems lately, and I wanted to talk about them, and maybe get some advice."
Dr. Szozas smiles broadly, and leans forward slightly, "Elizabeth, I think we can help each other. What sorts of difficulties have you experienced recently?  " He pauses, and looks at me expectantly.
I swallow nervously, and say, "Uh...well..." I clear my throat, and continue, "I uh...have had this recurring dream where I wake up in the middle of the night and find myself naked, but covered in blood. And there's also a second part, and I don't know what it means."
Dr. Szozas remains silent for a moment, and then inquires, "Do you remember the details of the dreams?"
I answer, "Yes, they were very vivid, and disturbing. I saw a woman's face, and she was screaming, and I was covered in her blood. The next morning, I woke up, and I was soaked in sweat, and I felt sick. I was afraid to go to sleep, because I didn't want to experience those awful dreams again. I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to forget them."
Dr. Szozas sits back, and regards me, and after a few moments, he responds, "That is quite a story, and certainly sounds frightening. Let's start by reviewing some basic facts. Are you sexually active, and do you engage in any risky behavior?"
I nod, and reply, "I'm a virgin, and I haven't done anything sexual since my last period ended two weeks ago. I'm not sure if I should consider that risky, or normal."
Dr. Szozas continues, "

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Michael, but I prefer Mike."
He nods, "Go ahead, tell me about your problem," he prompts.
So I start by telling him that I've been feeling strange lately, and then things started happening. It all began after I had a dream where I was watching myself, but somehow I was also observing another person doing the same thing. The other person looked just like me! And then I noticed that there were two versions of me, one real, and the other not real. There was a version of me that I couldn't touch or feel. This wasn't a lucid dream; this was reality. I felt like I was experiencing multiple realities at once, although they seemed very separate and distinct. 
Then the strangest part happened; I found out that I knew the other person, even though I didn't know her personally. She appeared in my dreams, in my mind. We spoke, and we shared thoughts, and I learned something important.
I realized that the woman I saw in my dreams, the woman I thought I recognized, she is actually a different person than I am. I don't know the woman, and I have never met her in my life. I can only assume that I must be seeing a projection, a hallucination, a memory, a fantasy, a delusion, a delusion, a phantasm, a mirage, a reflection, a ghost, a doppelg√§nger, a double, a twin, a clone, a copy, a simulation, a parallel universe, a simulacrum, a shadow, a sim, a stand-in, a substitute, a surrogate, a double, a counterfeit, a fake, a sham, a phantom, a figment, a likeness, a duplicate, a second self, an alter ego, a soul-mate, a double, a twin, a replica, a double, a replacement, a doppleganger, a false identity,

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is David. I'm 23 years old, single, male Caucasian, 5'-10", 180 pounds, brown hair, blue eyes."
He nods, waiting patiently, "And why did you come?"
I pause, and think about this, then I say, "I don't know..."
Dr. Szozas smiles kindly, "OK... Let's start by getting you situated, shall we? How long have you been feeling off, Mr. David?"
I tell him that I've had a sense of unease for several months now. It started slowly, but recently I can feel myself slipping away from reality. My mind becomes fuzzy and unfocused, and I find myself daydreaming all the time.  I also mentioned that I get strange sensations in my chest and stomach, and sometimes I experience headaches and nausea.
Dr. Szozas listens intently, and asks questions, and I answer them honestly, "What do you remember, exactly?"
I recall being at work for a while, I was a waiter at a restaurant, and I felt a little woozy, and I asked my manager if I should go home early. She said I didn't need to, she gave me a ride. I was still a little dizzy, and I got out of the car, and I was walking along the street, and I was trying to keep my balance. I was heading back to the restaurant, and I was thinking, 'I'm not too far, I'll be OK.' But I was unsteady, and I tripped, and I fell. I landed hard on my left elbow, and I was in pain. I was confused, and I looked at my forearm; I saw a small cut, I must have scraped my elbow on the pavement. I tried to stand up, but I couldn't, I could barely move. I wanted to call an ambulance for my arm, but I just stood there.

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My full name is Richard Allen Smith." I pause there, because this is where I need to tell him something important, but what? What can I say that will help him understand what is happening to me? I don't know yet. Maybe I should just ask him about his work. That would be easier than telling him anything else.
He nods, "Go ahead, please continue," he encourages.
So I do.  "I want to talk to you about an issue that I have been dealing with for quite some time now. It involves a recurring nightmare, one which I had for years until recently when things started getting worse..."
Dr. Szozas listens intently as I describe the dream. In fact, he asks questions along the way, such as whether or not the person I dreamed was male or female, or if they were wearing clothes in the dream, and other details. I answer all of his questions honestly, and then he pauses for a moment, and his face is serious.
"I think I may have a solution for you, but I need to know more. Please tell me everything about the dreams. Every single detail."
I start to explain the dream, starting with its beginning, and then I get into the middle and the end, the part I've never revealed before. I tell him everything: the people involved; the setting; the dialogue; the emotions; the events; the whole story.
When I finish talking, I wait for his reaction. He sits silently for a while, and I wonder if I said too much, maybe I went overboard. But he finally speaks up, "Richard, I believe I have a good idea of what is going on for you. Do you feel comfortable speaking to me about it?"
I nod, and I reply, "Yes, I guess I am. I was wondering if you could give me a little advice on how to deal with the situation I'm in. I need

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Elizabeth Lizzie Jones." 
He smiles, "Elizabeth...Liz?" 
"Yes, Liz," I say, feeling myself blush a little, but I don't let go of his hand. 
"Alright then, Liz..." he begins, "Why are you here? What brings you here today?" 
"Well, um, I think I have problems with men," I confess. My face turns red, and I glance away, embarrassed.
Dr. Szozas looks surprised, "Problems with men? How do you define that?" 
"Um...well I've never been able to find a good guy, I guess. Maybe I just haven't met the right one yet. I know there were times when I thought maybe I was gay, and now I wonder if I was really bi. I also had this weird phase where I would fantasize about being with women. And I even tried dating a girl once, and she was really nice, but I wasn't attracted to her at all, and I couldn't get into the relationship. It was really confusing for a while. I'm still confused, actually. I feel like I can't trust any guys, and I want to trust them. But I don't. I really don't know what I am. I'm not sure if I'm straight, or if I'm a lesbian, or if I'm bisexual, or if I'm something else. I'm not sure. I don't know what to call myself, and I don't know if I'll ever figure it out."
I pause, and Dr. Szozas is quiet. He leans forward, and his eyes widen a bit. "You're having trouble defining who you are because of the confusion surrounding sexuality," he states, "I understand. You may be asexual, or pan-romantic, or demi-hetero, and I'm sure you'd rather not

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Samara, and I've been seeing Dr. Szozas for several sessions now."
He nods, and looks back at his computer screen, then turns to face me again, and asks, "What brings you here today?"
I tell him about my issues, which have become increasingly more complicated and confusing. I start by telling him that I feel isolated, alone, and unhappy. I explain that I can't sleep, because I keep thinking and worrying all night long, and that I find myself constantly wanting things that I know will never happen. I also talk about the sexual side of my life, and how I want to lose weight, but I don't know if this is possible.
Dr. Szozas listens intently, and he smiles gently at me, nodding along as I speak, "So what do you think is causing all these problems? What are they trying to get at?"
I shrug, and I reply, "I don't know. I just... I wish I knew. I hate being confused and not understanding what is happening to me. It feels wrong, and I'm scared. I need help."
The doctor leans forward, and puts his elbows on his knees, and he strokes his chin, "Hmm, let's go through the symptoms one at a time, and we'll try and figure out what is going on, alright?"
I nod, "OK, sure. I guess I should start at the beginning, huh?"
I sigh, and I begin, "I was born in a small town in the Midwest, and I had a pretty normal childhood. I went to a good public school, and I graduated high school at 18. I got a job in the city, and I worked there for two years. I moved out and found an apartment, and my roommate helped me move in. I met a guy named Mike, and I fell in love with him. We started dating, and I

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Sarah Elizabeth Moore."
"Thank you. Now tell me about this issue you've been experiencing?"
"Well, I..."
He cuts me off by holding up his hands, palms outward, and leaning forward, "Sarah, please don't worry if what you have to say isn't very coherent right now. It will all become clearer once we start talking. Just try to relax, okay? Let's begin at the beginning."
I nod, and I feel myself relaxing somewhat as I listen to his soothing voice, "Good...  ."
So I talk. The story starts when I was a young girl, maybe 8 or 9 years old. I remember being excited because Mommy and Daddy were getting a new puppy, but then I woke up one morning, and the dog had disappeared! I cried, and I asked my parents where the dog went, and they didn't know either. They tried to comfort me, telling me that the dog probably just got tired, and decided to go home on its own. But I knew better, I knew that something bad happened, and I started to cry even more.
After a while, I stopped crying, and I felt a little guilty for feeling sad when the family pet was missing. My mother took me to the vet, and I remembered that the veterinarian looked at my stomach, and she said that I was pregnant. I couldn't believe that I was having a baby, I thought I wasn't a virgin anymore.
I kept thinking back to the day I became pregnant. I was masturbating in my room, and I saw a reflection of my naked body in the mirror. I gasped when I realized that I was already showing; I wondered if my father would be mad at me for becoming pregnant before marriage.
I began to think about my daddy, and I wanted to call him, I wanted to ask his advice on whether I should keep the child, I really loved my dad, he always

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My full name is Rachel Elizabeth Sorenson."
He looks at me curiously, "And what brings you to me?"
"Well, I've been having... uh..." I start, then pause, unsure of what to say next.
Dr. Szozas smiles kindly, "It's ok, don't worry about that right now, we can talk more later.  But let's get started, shall we? Why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself?"
So I do. I explain that I have had an issue for the past several months, and I haven't really known where to turn, or even if I should. It all began when I was a senior in high school, and I started to feel different things for certain people. For instance, my friend Hannah, whom I dated for a while. We were both seniors, and she just seemed to fit perfectly into my life. She was smart, pretty, and we got along great. I liked her, but I also wanted something else.
I found myself attracted to another girl at our local college, and I thought I loved her too. But I never acted on those feelings. I knew I would lose my virginity to Hannah, and I didn't want to ruin my relationship with my girlfriend. I tried to ignore my urges, but they only grew stronger. I finally decided to confront my problem, so I went to a counselor. He asked me questions, and I answered honestly, and I explained my situation.
The counselor suggested that I needed to find a way to deal with my emotions, and I agreed. He said I shouldn't rush into anything, I should take my time and figure out the best course of action.
I spent a lot of time thinking about my situation, and I came up with a plan. I found a website called 'WebMD,' and I read a few articles. I learned a bit about the nature of my condition, and I realized

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Jules."
He nods encouragingly, "And why do you think that we should meet?"
"Because I want help," I say, and then I go on to explain about my situation. The way that my mind works, and what's happening inside of me. And finally, I tell him about my thoughts and feelings regarding sex. I don't know if this is something normal, but I feel compelled to share all of that with him.
Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding along, and asking questions now and again. When I finish, he asks me to elaborate on certain points.
"Well, I have a lot of urges that I can't control. It's very confusing for me; I've never felt anything like this before. Like, I get horny, I just want to fuck somebody, any girl, I'll even fuck a guy if I really wanted to, and I just keep thinking about it. I masturbated a few times today, and I was surprised at the amount of pleasure I got. But I also had the most intense orgasm ever. My whole body was tingling, and I was totally drained afterwards. 
"I thought I was having a stroke, because I couldn't move for a while. I was worried I might die. I was sweating, my heart was racing, I was out cold. I woke up in a sweat, and I was still weak and shaky. I was afraid to move, I was scared to try to walk, and I was really embarrassed. I went to the bathroom, and I saw my reflection in the mirror, and I was shocked at the sight. I looked disgusting, I was covered in cum, my face, my hair, my chest, everywhere. I washed my hands a couple of times, and I used my towel to wipe myself off a little, but the rest was pretty much gone. I put on my clothes, and I left the
