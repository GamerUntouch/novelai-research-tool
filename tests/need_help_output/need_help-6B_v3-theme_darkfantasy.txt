=== Prompt ========================================
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "

=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Daphne Wohltat."
He nods slowly, then asks, "And why have you chosen to seek counseling?"
"Well..." I begin hesitantly, "You know... I've been feeling strange lately, and I think maybe there's something wrong with me. It started with this weird dream last night, where I can feel things inside me, and I don't understand what they are. And I woke up today thinking about stuff that happened before I was born. Stuff about people I never knew, or places I've never seen. Weird stuff. It's all really confusing. I just want to talk about it."
Dr. Szozas smiles kindly, "That sounds very normal. Tell me more about your dreams. What did you dream about? Can you remember any details about them?"
"It was pretty vague, actually. All I recall is that I was dreaming about myself as a child, and I felt confused by what I saw. But one part stood out to me: I dreamed that I had a friend named Kaitlin. She said she loved me, but I couldn't figure out why. That was the only real memory from the whole dream. There were other parts, but I'm not sure if I should share those with you, because I'm not sure if I'm allowed to tell anyone about them. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to trust you or not, I guess."
Szozas looks thoughtful for a moment, "Tell me about the other memories, the ones that seem to be about people that you've never met. Do you recognize their names, anything about their appearance, do you even know if they are men or women?"
I shake my head no, "No, I don't. They are mostly fuzzy. I get the sense that I'm trying to connect with these people, but I can't quite grasp who or what they are. I wish I could

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Dara, and...well..." I pause again, unsure where to start. What can I tell this doctor? That I have been having nightmares since puberty? Nightmares of being chased by monsters, or worse yet, monsters chasing me? Or perhaps that I feel different than other people? Do I want to tell him all of those things? And if I do, will he think I'm crazy too? Is there any chance he'll send me away without helping me? I don't know if I should trust him. But then, what else can I do? It's either go to him or continue living with my fears until they drive me insane. I decide to try and explain myself, and hope that I won't regret doing so.
"It started when I was just a little girl," I begin. My hands shake slightly as I hold them together between my knees. "When I was five years old, I had the worst nightmare ever."
Dr. Szozas nods encouragingly, and sits forward, "Go ahead, please."
So I recount to him the story of the nightmarish experience that haunted me for years afterward: the dream of a small, dark room with an unseen monster lurking inside. The dream was always the same; I was trapped within the confines of a tiny, pitch black room, with no windows, no doors, nothing but a single light bulb hanging from the ceiling. A creature lurked within the darkness; a hideous beast that breathed fire and smelled terrible. I would run frantically through the walls and floors of the chamber; the only exit was a trapdoor at the bottom of the room. I'd reach the door, but I couldn't open it; I was unable to escape the horror that awaited me beyond the door. I was helpless against the terror that came with the dream, and I would wake up screaming and crying out.
As I spoke, I could see Dr. Szozas' face change

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Alyssa." My heart pounds away against my chest. What will this doctor think? Will he believe me? Is there any way that he'll understand what happened to me? And then I realize: This isn't just about me. It's about all those people. They need help too.
"Alyssa...?" The doctor asks, "What brings you to our little clinic today?"
I answer again, nervously, "Well..."
He smiles kindly, "Just relax. Take deep breaths. Tell me what brought you here."
So I tell him, "This morning, I woke up, and I felt really weird. Like something wasn't right. I couldn't focus. I had trouble thinking straight. I was trying to do math problems, but they were wrong answers. I got frustrated, and I started yelling at myself, 'You can't even count!' That's when I realized that I was talking to myself. But it didn't matter. I kept doing it anyway, because I knew that if I stopped, I wouldn't be able to get back up. I tried to go outside, but I couldn't move. Everything seemed frozen. All the doors and windows were locked. I thought that I would die that day, but I survived somehow. I finally found a window that opened, but I still couldn't leave. I went into the bathroom, but I couldn't use the toilet. I tried to drink water, but I couldn't swallow. I wanted to scream, but I couldn't open my mouth or make a sound. I felt sick to my stomach, but I also felt numb. I don't know how long I stayed like that, but eventually I heard a voice calling out to me from inside the house. I remember hearing the words, "Help me!" and "It hurts!" I tried to call out to them, but I couldn't speak or make a noise at all. I panicked, but I

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Lucinda."
He nods slowly, "And why did you decide to seek professional counseling?"
I pause again, then say, "It started about two months ago. It was just one day after I had gotten back from vacation in Europe, and suddenly I felt this overwhelming sense of dread. I tried to ignore it, but I couldn't shake off those feelings. They were getting worse, more intense by the hour, until finally they overwhelmed me completely. When I woke up the next morning, I knew something wasn't right. My stomach hurt, and I felt nauseous. I went to work, but I didn't feel well enough to do much of anything. The rest of the day was pretty miserable too. By evening though, things seemed normal. I guess I thought it was all a bad dream or something. But when I got home, the feeling came back stronger than ever. And now it's been about three weeks since I've returned, and it hasn't stopped yet. I'm afraid to go out at night, because when I do, the feeling comes back even worse. I can't sleep well either; I toss and turn most nights, tossing and turning for hours before falling asleep, only to wake up at 4am, the same time I always used to get up. If I try to nap during the afternoon, the fear gets worse, and I have trouble sleeping at night. I've never experienced these kinds of symptoms before, not even close. I don't know what to do. What am I dealing with? I need help!"
Dr. Szozas sits quietly, listening intently. His hands are clasped together between his knees, his face is serious, but his smile is still there, "Tell me about the other people in your life, and about the events that led up to where you are today."
So I tell him about my parents, how we moved to the city, about the job I had

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Angie." My voice sounds strange coming out of this deep masculine throat, and I feel embarrassed by it.
He nods approvingly, "That's a good start." And then he asks me questions, gentle and caring ones, until I can relax enough to tell him what happened. When I finish telling him, he listens intently without interruption, nodding occasionally, taking notes on a small pad that rests next to his computer screen. Finally, after what feels like hours, he looks up at me, and smiles again, "So, do you want to talk more about this?"
I nod, and he continues, "Angela, let me ask you something: have you ever been sexually assaulted before? Or had any other traumatic experiences?"
This question surprises me, and I think back to the night before, when I was attacked. I don't remember anything else after being knocked unconscious, but I know that I was raped. "Yes," I say quietly.
Dr. Szozas sits up straight in his chair, "And did you report the incident to the police?"
I shake my head slowly, trying to control the tears that threaten to spill forth. I'm ashamed of myself for not reporting the rape sooner, but I didn't trust the authorities to help me, I thought they would laugh at me or worse.
"Why not?"
"Because..." I begin, but the words catch in my throat, and I stop talking. The truth is, there were too many reasons.
"Go ahead," he encourages me gently.
"Well, I... I just didn't believe that the cops would care about me or help me."
"But I assure you that the police will be very interested in your case," he assures me.
"How do you know that?"
"Because I am a psychiatrist, and I specialize in unusual cases," he answers with a smile.
"What exactly does that mean?"

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Milla Bowers."  And then I continue, "You know, I think this might have something to do with my family history."
He nods, "That makes sense." He looks away for just a moment, and thinks, before continuing, "It's probably best if we start by talking about your childhood." And with those words, he turns back to face me.
"OK..." I say, nervously. What did I expect? A big scary doctor to tell me that I had cancer or something? But instead, I get a nice guy asking questions. This is almost too easy... Almost.
Dr. Szozas asks all kinds of questions: Where were you born? How old are you now? Do you live alone? Have any siblings? Are there any other children in the house? Does anyone else help raise you? Did you go to school last year? Is your mother still alive?
After a while, I feel like an idiot answering his questions. The only things I can remember about my past are vague memories of a couple of different schools, and a few years spent living with my grandmother after she died. I don't even really recall much about her death, or what happened afterwards. I guess I was pretty young when that happened. It was a long time ago.
Then I remember that I was supposed to be meeting with a lawyer today; I hadn't thought about that since the morning. Oh yeah, I was going to meet with a lawyer about getting a divorce. I wonder if I should mention that to the doctor. I'm not sure what I want to happen with the divorce; I haven't decided yet. I'll wait until I talk with the lawyer first. I decide to keep that tidbit to myself for the moment.
Finally, I realize that I'm feeling very relaxed, and I'm sure that I've answered most of his questions. I'm not sure if I was being interrogated,

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Rose."   I pause again, and then add, "And I want to get help because...well..." I sigh heavily, trying to find the words, "Because I don't know what's wrong with me. It feels like there is something inside me, something alien, but I can't quite pin point where exactly it is. And it makes me feel sick sometimes, all twisted up. Like I might throw up any second."
He nods, and asks, "What do you think this 'something' is?"
I shrug, "It doesn't really matter. What matters is that it is making me miserable."
He looks concerned, "Can you give me an example? Please?"
So I try to explain. "Well, if I go into a room alone, without anyone else present, I start feeling dizzy and nauseous. If I stand up too fast, or walk too much, I'll feel light headed and disoriented. My stomach starts churning, and my vision blurs. Sometimes I have trouble breathing. But it passes after a few minutes, and I'm fine afterwards."
He smiles gently at me, "That sounds very similar to a panic attack, but I'd need more information to be certain. I will ask you a series of questions, and we may discuss them together to determine whether they are related to the same phenomenon." He pauses to collect his thoughts, and then continues, "Do you mind if I use a pen and paper to write things down while I talk to you?"
I nod, and he picks up a mechanical pencil from his desk, and jots a couple notes down. I feel a little silly sitting on a couch, with a psychiatrist, but I am willing to be helpful. I answer his questions carefully, but honestly. I tell him about the web searches, the email to Dr. Szozas, and the meeting with the police.

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Emma Hensley."
He nods, "And why do we meet?"
"Well..." I begin, then pause again, unsure where this is headed, "it's... complicated."
"We can talk about that later," he says reassuringly, "but let's start by talking about what brings you here today."
I try to find the words to describe the strange things happening inside me, and how they seem connected to other people. But before I know it, I have already started talking. I tell him about my nightmares, about being chased through the woods, and seeing others running after me, but not knowing why. I explain how sometimes I feel like there is something chasing me too, but when I look back I don't see anyone following me.
When I finish telling him all about the nightmare, he looks up at me with a thoughtful expression, "That sounds very real to me."
"It feels real," I say, "and I'm scared."
Dr. Szozas leans forward, putting his elbows on his knees, resting his chin on his interlaced fingers, "You said earlier that you felt different than usual, but did anything else happen? Did you ever feel 'out of sorts,' or 'different' about anything else?"
"Um, yeah, I guess. I've been feeling really tired lately. And I had a headache yesterday, but I think that was just stress related to the job hunt. I got a call from a recruiter last night that I might get an interview with a company that I applied to a few months ago. I was excited about that until I remembered that I was supposed to be interviewing with them tomorrow!" I exclaim, "What does that have to do with anything?"
"Just listen," Dr. Szozas says gently, and I nod.
"So, I was getting ready to go out to dinner with a friend tonight, but I woke up

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Jane Doe."
He nods slowly, his gaze still locked onto mine. "And why have you decided to visit me today?"
I pause again, then say, "Well, because... I don't know..." My mind races, trying to figure out what this strange feeling inside me is all about. It feels like there's something wrong with me, but I can't put my finger on what exactly it is. I try to think back to times before now where I felt the same way. But nothing springs to mind. And I feel like if I didn't do something soon, I would explode. Like something terrible was waiting just outside the door, ready to pounce and kill me at any moment. I fear that I've been caught up in something much bigger than myself, and I'm afraid to find out what it is. "Because I'm not sure what else to do," I admit. "This isn't normal."
Dr. Szozas looks thoughtful, pondering a question, or perhaps thinking about a diagnosis. His eyebrows furrow slightly, which only makes him seem more handsome somehow. He looks up at me, his eyes intent and serious, "What aren't you sure about? What is making you nervous about coming to see me?"
I shrug, "Everything, I guess. The whole situation. I don't even know if I'm doing the right thing. I want to trust people, but I'm scared to death to trust anyone with this problem. I'm worried that I'm going to get hurt if I open up to others. I'm not sure I'm qualified to be a therapist, but I'm also terrified that I'm the one that needs help, but I'm too proud to ask for it. I'm confused. I'm angry. I'm sad. I'm lonely. I'm anxious. I'm lost. I'm frustrated. I'm depressed. I'm terrified. I'm desperate to be

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Emi Kuzumi."
He nods, and asks, "And why have you chosen to seek counseling?"
I answer, "I think there may be something wrong with me. Something bad... Maybe I've done something terrible..."
"Something 'terrible', huh? Well, let's start by getting some information, shall we?"
I nod, and tell him what happened last night. When I finish, he looks thoughtful, then he sits back in his chair, and rubs his chin thoughtfully. The silence stretches out between us, until finally he speaks, "You said that the other day you were having trouble sleeping?"
I nod again, and say, "Yes, ever since that happened yesterday morning. I woke up this morning feeling really groggy, and I had trouble concentrating during class. And I keep waking up late at night because I can't get back to sleep."
Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding along with each statement I make. He gets up, and starts walking about the room, stopping now and then to pick up a book or magazine off one of his shelves. After about ten minutes of pacing, he stops, turns to face me, "How do you feel right now?"
I pause, "What does that mean?"
"Do you feel anxious, depressed, angry, fearful, hopeless, guilty, ashamed, embarrassed, confused, sad, lonely, empty, worthless, helpless, inadequate, unworthy, guilty, ashamed, afraid, frustrated, disappointed, lost, desperate, terrified, miserable, and/or suicidal?"
I look at him blankly, "Um, no, I don't know how to answer that question. I guess I'm not sure if I'm any of those things yet. I'm just trying to figure out where to begin. I'm tired all the time, I wake up at odd times, and I can't concentrate very well when I'm awake
