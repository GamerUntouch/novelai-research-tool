My name is Kristen Laskowski."
He nods, then asks, "How old are you?"
"Twenty one years old," I answer truthfully, hoping that this will prove enough information.
"And where do you live? What country?"
"I live in New York City."
"What brings you to our little town?" he inquires gently.
So far, things have gone very smoothly. He wants to know all sorts of details about me, which makes sense because I don't want to tell anyone anything unless they ask me directly. And since I've never been anywhere else except the city before, there isn't much I can say without being asked more questions. So I just keep talking, telling him what I feel safe saying.
Dr. Szozas listens attentively, nodding occasionally, asking pertinent questions when necessary. When I finish my story, he sits back in his chair, thinking deeply. He looks up at me, his smile fading slightly, "Kristen... I think we need to talk about something a bit different than usual. You seem rather... withdrawn. Do you understand what I'm trying to say?"
"Yes sir," I reply slowly, not knowing exactly what he means by that.
"Good girl," he smiles again, his dimples coming out briefly. Then he continues, "You are obviously suffering from depression, but that's only part of the problem. There are other factors that are contributing to your overall unhappiness, but those are secondary to your mental state at present. So let's start with the basics: Why are you depressed?"
I try to explain myself to him, but his expression changes, becoming pensive, and his face grows serious.
"Have you ever had any problems with drugs or alcohol, Kristen?"
"No sir!" I snap at him, startled by his sudden change in demeanor.
"Do you drink at all?"
"Not really. But I did

My name is Allison."  He nods, and then he asks, "And what brings you to our clinic today?"
So I tell him about the dreams, the voices, and the panic attacks... He listens intently while I talk, nodding occasionally. When I finish talking, he looks at me again, and says, "Allison, do you have any idea what might be causing this? Do you think there is anything else we should know about?"
Again, I hesitate before answering. But he does seem genuine, and sincere, so I reply, "No, nothing really stands out to me, except maybe..." I pause, unsure if I want to say something wrong, or even if it would matter.
"Yes?" he prompts gently.
"Well, I've been having nightmares lately, where I'm being chased by a monster. It's very realistic, almost too real. And sometimes it feels like I can hear people screaming, but they aren't actually there. That scares me, because I feel like I'm losing touch with reality somehow."
Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair, thinking about this information. He responds after a few seconds, "That sounds quite disturbing. Have you ever experienced anything similar before?"
Now I'm starting to get worried; I don't want to sound crazy. I answer carefully, "Not exactly like that, but I had an experience once that scared me pretty bad.  It was just a couple years ago, but I remember it vividly. I was walking home from school one day, when suddenly, out of nowhere, this car came barreling at me. The next thing I knew, I was flat on my ass, watching the driver step out of his vehicle, and grab me.
But when I woke up, I couldn't move, and I felt paralyzed with fear. I was terrified that I'd be killed right then, and that my soul would go to hell

My name is Aimee."
He nods.  "And why have you contacted me?"
Now, this question throws me off guard.  I know that there's something wrong with me, but I don't think it's anything serious enough to warrant professional help.  But maybe I should get help?  What do I want help for?  It just doesn't seem important... yet.
So I tell him what happened last night, and then I describe the events leading up to my visit today.
"Did you sleep well last night?" asks Dr. Szozas.
I nod, "Yes, thank goodness.  That was the only time I've slept soundly since..."
He cuts me off before I can say more, "Let's start by getting an accurate picture of what's going on inside your head right now.  Do you feel any different than usual?"
I shake my head, "No.  Just tired.  Actually, I'm feeling really good physically, but mentally, I'm not sure what to call it exactly.  It feels like... well, nothing bad is happening, but I also feel very contented, satisfied with myself."
Dr. Szozas looks at me intently, his face impassive, "How long have you felt this way?"
"Since yesterday morning.  Maybe even earlier."
"Have you been doing much physical activity lately?"
"A little bit.  Yesterday was pretty strenuous, but that was mostly because I had to work late at my job, but that was no big deal.  Today, I ran errands, went grocery shopping, did some housework, cleaned up the kitchen, and took care of some other stuff.  Nothing special.  Other than that, I haven't done much else.  Last night was the first real chance I got to relax and unw

My name is Mary Jane." And then I pause again, because this is really weird... "and uhm, I think something might be wrong with me..."
He nods slowly, and smiles, and asks, "What do you mean by 'wrong'? Do you have any symptoms?"
I blink back tears, thinking about what's happening to me, and I say softly, "Well, um, sometimes I can hear voices? Sometimes they tell me things, or ask me questions, and I just don't know if I should answer them. Other times I feel like there are people watching me all the time, and that makes me uncomfortable, too..."
Dr. Szozas sits forward slightly, leaning toward me, and he looks intently at me, nodding slowly, "Yes, yes, those are very common symptoms of schizophrenia. It is not uncommon for patients to experience auditory hallucinations, or paranoia. Are you experiencing any other symptoms?"
Oh God, I thought, now we're getting somewhere. But I'm relieved when I realize that I haven't been hallucinating, at least not yet. I shake my head no.
Dr. Szozas leans back into his chair, and rubs his hands together, "Do you recall anything about your childhood that might explain these symptoms?"
I nod, trying to remember what happened during the last few months that would cause such intense anxiety. As far as I can remember, nothing bad had occurred recently; maybe I was stressed out from work? Maybe it was an accident at home? No, that doesn't seem right.
"Are you married?" Dr. Szozas inquires.
"No," I reply, shaking my head no.
"Is anyone else living with you?"
"Just me, myself, and I," I say, nodding my head no.
"Have you ever taken medications for depression, or anxiety?"
"Um, no," I admit.
"How

My name is Karen, and..."
He interrupts me, saying, "Just state your name."
"Karen... My name is Karen," I repeat myself, trying hard not to sound impatient.
"Good, now tell me where you live," he states matter-of-factly, without any trace of sarcasm.
"In Los Angeles," I say, feeling awkward because I don't know what else to say.
"What do you do?" he asks, sounding very curious.
"I work in sales, selling computers and related equipment," I reply, wondering if this is really going to help me get better or not?
"Do you have children?" he inquires next.
"Yes, two boys," I answer, then pause.
"They both attend private schools, one in LA, the other in New York City," I add.
"Are they happy kids?" he asks after a momentary silence.
"Oh yes!" I exclaim, surprised by his question.
"Why did you come to see me today, Karen?" he presses further.
"Because I'm freaking out!" I confess, unable to keep quiet about my anxiety.
"You seem calm enough to me," he comments, and he smiles again.
"I am calm," I insist, but inside I feel anything but.
"Is there something wrong with you that makes you want to talk to me?" he probes.
"Well, no, not exactly," I mumble.
"Then what's wrong with you?"
"I just need to find out what's happening to me, I guess. I've been having these feelings lately, I can't explain them, but I think it's serious. I thought maybe I should speak with someone who knew more than I did."
Dr. Szozas'eyes widen with understanding; he leans forward in his chair and places his elbows on his knees, resting his

My name is Laura."
He nods, "And why are you here?"
"Well, I've been having trouble sleeping lately... maybe because of this weird dream I had last night..." My face reddens slightly as I continue. "... It was really strange, and scary, too. And now I can't get back to sleep."
He smiles again, "So tell me what happened."
I recount the events of my nightmare, trying to keep myself calm by telling him about the monster. The doctor listens intently, nodding occasionally. When I finish, he asks, "Have you ever heard of 'the boogeyman,' or anything similar? Have any friends mentioned something similar happening to them recently?"
I shake my head, "No, not at all. But I have never seen anything like that before, either.  But there was one part of it that scared me more than anything else: after the monster left, I woke up, and my mother was standing right beside my bed. She looked terrified, and she kept saying to me, 'Laura, please wake up.' That's when I realized that whatever it was, it wasn't just a bad dream."
Dr. Szozas sits quietly for several moments, thinking. Finally, he responds, "Let me ask you another question. Do you believe in ghosts, spirits, demons, vampires, etcetera?"
Again I nod, feeling relieved to finally be able to talk about it without being afraid.  I answer, "Yes."
"Do you believe that they exist, that they are real, that we should be careful about believing in things that are beyond our understanding, that might be dangerous to us?"
I pause, then say, "I think I do."
"That's good.  Now let me ask you to imagine that this spirit, this thing that appears in your dreams, is somehow related to that belief that you hold. Can you see

My name is Kelly Smith."
He nods slowly, "And why do you think you're here?"
"Well..." I begin hesitantly, then I blurt out, "I feel different... somehow. Different than other people. It started last night, after I went to bed. I woke up this morning feeling exhausted, even though I slept late. My mind felt fuzzy, sluggish, like there were cotton balls stuck inside my head. And I kept thinking, 'this isn't right'. The next day was just like yesterday, except that I had more energy, and I didn't sleep very much, maybe two hours total. But now today, I can barely keep my eyes open, and I have a terrible headache. When I get up in the mornings, I don't feel rested at all. Like something is wrong with me, but I can't figure out what it is."
Dr. Szozas smiles gently, nodding his head slowly, "That's quite an interesting story. Let me ask you one question, and please answer honestly: Are you using any drugs or alcohol? Have you been diagnosed with anything?" He asks carefully, probing into my mind.
I'm taken aback by his directness, but I tell him, "No, nothing like that. No alcohol, no prescription medication. Nothing. I've never used them before, not once. Not ever!"
He nods again, smiling kindly at me, "Thank goodness. That would explain a lot, wouldn't it? Well, let me give you some background information about me, and about our relationship. I am not a licensed psychologist, nor am I a doctor; I am a psychiatrist. A psychiatrist specializes in mental health issues. We are trained to diagnose patients based on their symptoms, and to determine if they are suffering from a disorder. We are also trained to treat those disorders with medications, counseling, therapy, etcetera. So, with that being said, we

My name is Amy Browning."
He smiles again, and nods, "Amy, tell me more about what brought you to this point..."
So I do...
I start by telling him about my obsession with finding my father, which led me to search the internet for clues. It turns out there were several articles posted online about my dad's disappearance, including one article written by a Dr. Michael Szozas. When I saw the author had published two books, I thought maybe he knew something about my dad. That got me started thinking about all kinds of things.
Then I explained what happened after I found that article: The next day, I went to work, then came home, ate dinner, watched TV, took a bath, did homework, tried to sleep, woke up, showered, put makeup on (for the first time ever), brushed my hair, dressed, drove to the restaurant where I worked, waited outside until they opened, then walked inside, ordered food, sat at a table, talked with friends about nothing in particular. After eating, I left the restaurant, stopped at a store, bought lipstick and blush, and drove home. My car was parked in front of our house, so I didn't bother to park anywhere else.
When I pulled into the driveway, I noticed that the light was still off. So I climbed out of the car, unlocked the door, and turned on the lights. As soon as I stepped through the door, I felt dizzy, disoriented, sick, scared, and lonely. Everything looked different than usual. Then I heard music playing from upstairs.
The song sounded familiar; I recognized it right away. I ran up the stairs and grabbed the phone. I called my mom's cell number, but she wasn't picking up. So I left a message asking her if she would please call me back.
As I hung up, I realized that I hadn't done any laundry or washed dishes

My name is Emma."
He nods slowly, still staring intently at me.
"Emma, please tell us what brings you here today?"
"Well... I've been having strange dreams lately, they don't seem to have any context, just fragments. They feel real, but I can't remember anything else about them. The last one, I woke up screaming, and then I felt sick and dizzy all day yesterday. It feels like there are things going on inside my head, but I'm not sure what or where. That's why I wanted to talk to you..."
Dr. Szozas leans back in his chair, crossing his legs. He smiles, nodding.  "Tell me more about the dream fragments."
So I do, telling him about waking up after the nightmare feeling nauseous, disoriented, and afraid.   He asks questions, asking if this happens often, or only once a week, or twice a month, etc., but I'm not sure how to answer that question. Finally, he gives me an encouraging nod and says, "OK, let's try something different." He stands up, walking over to his desk.
"How much alcohol have you had tonight?" he inquires.
"Not very much. I drank a glass of wine with dinner, but that was it. I think I'll be OK now that I know that it was only one drink."
Dr. Szozas looks at me curiously, and then writes something down on his pad. Then he sits down again.
"Let me ask you a few questions. Have you ever heard the term 'dream recall' before? Or'hypnagogic imagery'?"
"No, never. What are those terms?"
"Dream recall is when we wake from our sleep, but are unable to bring forth memories of that night's dream. Hypnagogic imagery refers to that which occurs while falling asleep, but

My name is Stephanie... Stephanie Miller."
He nods, and then asks, "And what do you want?"
I pause again, wondering if this was a mistake? Should I have called another doctor? But then I think: Why would anyone else know more than Dr. Szozas? This guy might just be able to figure things out. So I decide to tell him all about myself. It feels good to get off my chest. My story starts with my mother dying when I was very young, and her passing left me feeling lost and alone. I spent most of my childhood wandering aimlessly through life, until finally I ended up in college where I met Brian. We fell in love, and we got married shortly after graduation. We had our daughter together, and she was born healthy and happy. She's now eight years old, and she loves playing outside with her friends. Our marriage hasn't been perfect, but it's still going strong, and I feel blessed to have found such happiness.
Dr. Szozas listens intently to my tale, nodding occasionally, and asking questions when I falter or seem unsure. When I finish, he stands up from his chair, walks back across his office to me, and pulls out one of two chairs that face each other at the end of the couch. He sits down, and smiles at me. He looks into my eyes, and says, "So, what does that say about you, Stephanie?"
I sigh, realizing that I've opened myself up to an interrogation by Dr. Szozas, and that there's no turning back. So I answer honestly, "Well, I'm not sure.  I guess that means that I'm normal, right?  Or maybe that I'm abnormal.  I don't really know.  I wish that I did.  I'd like to be confident about that, but I'm afraid that I'll find that I'm wrong.
