=== Prompt ========================================
I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.

[Year: 2020 AD]
[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "


=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Jane Smith, and I've been feeling pretty depressed lately."
He nods, and leans forward slightly. "Why do you think this is happening?"
I pause again, and then answer, "I don't know."
He sits back, and smiles at me reassuringly. "That's ok... let's start there..." He looks at his watch, and checks the time, and then asks, "Can we get started now? I have other appointments today."
Oh God, I feel myself getting flustered, but I can't help it. He's making me nervous, and I say, "Yes, please go ahead..."
So he starts talking, slowly at first, and then picking up speed as he goes along. "I understand that you are having difficulty with a particular issue, and I want to try to help you find a solution to whatever is troubling you.   What is the matter?"
I explain the situation in great detail; the feelings I have about the situation, my actions leading up to the situation, my thoughts on the situation, my emotions associated with the situation, my memories of the situation, my expectations of the situation, my fears regarding the situation, my hopes for the situation, my dreams for the situation, my plans for the situation, my fantasies for the situation, my desires for the situation, my anxieties surrounding the situation, my sadness at the situation, my anger at the situation, my disappointment in the situation, my frustrations at the situation, my worries at the situation, my concerns at the situation, my paranoia at the situation, my shame at the situation, my guilt at the situation, my self-loathing at the situation, my sense of worthlessness at the situation, my despair at the situation, my grief at the situation, my fear for the future, my dread of the future, my worry about the future, my anxiety about the future, my loneliness in the future, my panic

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Samantha Covington. I have been experiencing severe mood swings since my sophomore year of high school. They started shortly after I became sexually active." My heart races as I speak, I've never spoken about this before.
He nods, and then asks, "How long did they last?"
"Well, initially... two weeks, maybe three..." I begin, but I can feel myself getting flustered, "and then one day, I just woke up, and I couldn't stop crying. It was awful. The next morning, I felt fine again. But for the rest of the week, I cried all the time, until finally I stopped. I don't know what happened."
"Hmm..." He thinks quietly for a moment, "It sounds like you were depressed. That's a fairly common symptom for women that become sexually active.  I'd recommend that we start by having a frank discussion about your sexual history, and the events leading up to the onset of your symptoms. Do you think you'll be willing to do that?”
I nod, "Yes sir, I will. I'm sorry if I seem nervous. I guess I am nervous. I haven't had much experience talking about sex. I've only ever done it a couple times, and I didn't really enjoy them. I think I should tell you that I've been a virgin my entire life. I'm 18 years old, and I'm in college, and I'm a freshman at the University of Southern California. I live in a dorm, and I go to a small liberal arts college. I'm a straight-A student, and I work part-time at a local coffee shop. I'm not sure if any of that is relevant to my case or not. I've always wanted to be a doctor, and I'm very excited about my future. I want to study medicine, and I hope I can help people.
I look at

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Alice St. John. My family calls me Alix."
He smiles again, then nods, and asks, "Why do they call you by this nickname?"
I pause, and I think for a moment about what I want to say, but then I decide on honesty, "Because I was born in a hospital called 'St. John.' It was a Catholic Hospital, run by nuns, and they were very strict about not letting anyone outside their order enter. They had a policy against having children adopted, or even being pregnant without permission. I was raised there until I turned eighteen years old."
Dr. Szozas looks at me for a long time, before responding, "And what happened after you left the institution? Where did you go? What sort of life have you led since leaving the facility?"
I shift uncomfortably on the couch, and finally answer, "Well, I went back to school, got a degree in business, and I've been working ever since. I started off at a small bank, and I worked my way up. I took a promotion to head up the branch where I live now. I work hard, and I try to be a good person, I just can't seem to shake the demons inside that place. I feel them sometimes, and I know that I need help. I'm afraid to tell my boss, though, because I don't want to lose my job, and I really need the money..."
"I understand completely, Miss St. John.  I'll be asking a lot of questions, and I'd like for you to give me honest answers. I won't judge you for anything that comes out of your mouth. I promise I will respect you, and I will listen to everything that you have to say.
I nod at the doctor, and I continue, "I'm not sure if my problems are psychological, or physical. I suffer from nightmares, and I often

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Dara Loomis. I've been seeing Dr. Szozas about an issue that I'm having."
He nods thoughtfully, and then responds, "Well, tell me more about this 'issue'," and I continue, "It started after I got engaged to Josh, and we were planning our wedding. We'd been together for five years, and things seemed perfect until..."
"What happened?" he asks gently, and I sigh heavily, and say, "I had a dream. It was very vivid and realistic, almost too real to be a dream. I dreamed that Josh cheated on me. He said he loved me, but I knew better. In the dream, I went to a party where everyone else was there. Everyone except for us. And they all laughed at us, and mocked us. They didn't even know who I really was.   I woke up crying, and I felt sick to my stomach for days afterwards.   I tried to talk to Josh about it, and he just brushed it off. I asked if I should break up with him, and he wouldn't hear of it. I can't believe I fell for his lies. I don't think I ever will again. 
I feel lost. I'm confused. I want to trust my fiancé, and I do, but I have to wonder if I'll always have to worry, wondering if he's cheating on me. I don't know what to do. I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, and I'm not sure how to determine if I'm in danger or in an abusive relationship. I'm not sure how to deal with the dreams and the anxiety. 
I'm afraid to leave my house, because I fear the nightmares. I'm afraid to go out in public, and I avoid meeting new people. I feel alone, and I'm scared to death of losing my friends. I

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Annabelle Thorne, and I've been seeing a therapist named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having."
He nods slowly, and then asks, "Do you have any idea what this 'issue' might be?"
"No sir, but I hope you can help me find out," I answer honestly, and I glance at his watch. It reads 8:55am. "Is now a good time? I don't want to keep you too long, I just need an appointment for next week..."
"Annabelle, please call me Mike. You can tell me anything right now, and we'll go from there. What do you know about therapy, specifically?"
I think for a moment, "Well... I went through a couple years of college, I had a job for a while, I was engaged once, and I was married for a year, and I got divorced.   I also dated a lot, but I didn't get very far. I met a guy online a few months ago, and I started talking to him on the phone for a little while, and I thought that things were getting serious. I even bought a new dress for our date, I was really excited, and I was planning on taking my car to meet him. He said that he was at work, and I should come by his office. When I arrived, I was surprised when he opened the door, and I saw that he wasn't wearing a suit. He told me to come in, and I did, and I sat on his sofa. We talked for a little bit, and I asked if I could kiss him. 
He said that he would, and I leaned forward, and he kissed me. I was shocked when his lips pressed against mine, and I felt my heart pounding in my chest. I pulled away and looked at him; he smiled, and I blushed and stammered

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Anna Kuznetsova." I pause. I have never been good at talking about myself, especially not to strangers. I feel embarrassed by this fact, but there's nothing else to do. The truth will just come out eventually, right? I continue, "Well... I guess I don't know what else to say. I've always had trouble trusting people, and now I can't trust anyone. My life is falling apart because of this issue. It's getting worse every day, I think. And then, when things get bad enough, they start happening all the time. Like today. Today was really terrible."
He nods thoughtfully, and offers a sympathetic smile, "It sounds very stressful for you. How long have you been experiencing these issues?"
"Since I got out of high school, actually. I started having them when I was fifteen years old. I've tried to talk to my parents, and I couldn't even begin to explain to them. I didn't want to scare them. They would call the police, and I'd end up in jail. I wanted to keep living my normal life, and I wasn't sure if I could anymore. I felt trapped. I felt suffocated. I couldn't breathe. I stopped eating. I cut off contact with everyone. I lost my friends. I became depressed. I went to the hospital, and I stayed for a while, and I did a lot of therapy. I took a bunch of pills. I talked to a shrink. I saw a counselor. I tried to kill myself. I kept trying to find a way out. I failed. I gave up. I'm sorry. I'm not making any sense at all. I'm a mess. I don't deserve to be alive. I'm such a horrible person for having lived at all. I'm worthless. But I still live, and that makes me a monster. I hate myself, and I wish I

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is  . My parents were immigrants to America, they arrived during World War II, and settled in New York City. They met each other while working in the garment industry, and then later both worked as secretaries. In 1948, my mother gave birth to her only child, a girl named  . When she was born, my father said, 'You will never call her by this silly sounding name.' But my mother refused, and insisted that we would always refer to our daughter as Maria." I pause briefly, and continue, "As a young adult, my sister moved away from home to attend college, but she still calls herself Maria." I shrug. "That's just what my mom called us, and I've been using the same nickname ever since."
Dr. Szozas nods along, and asks, "What do you think about that?"
I frown, and say, "It doesn't bother me, I guess. It's not important now, anyway. I'm not even sure if I'll keep my last name after I marry. I don't know if I want my wife to have my surname, or if I'd rather go back to being a simple, plain Jane, with no identity at all. I suppose I'm not sure if I can trust my family, or if I should try to distance myself from them. I feel I'm stuck in a rut, trapped in a cycle of life, a pattern that I cannot escape. I'm afraid to change, because I fear I might lose something. I don't know if I'm willing to risk losing my friends, my relationships, or my sanity. I'm scared of the unknown, I'm afraid to step out into the world, I'm afraid I won't fit in anymore. I'm not sure who I am, I'm not sure I'm a good person, I'm not sure I'm a bad one, and I'm certainly unsure if I deserve to be happy

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Mary Jane Watson." I pause there, because I don't know what else to say.
He nods, and responds, "And?"
"Oh...uh..." I stutter, "and uh, I've been having problems lately, I guess? Like, I can't seem to stop thinking about sex. It just keeps coming back to mind, even though I try not to think about it. And it makes me feel weird. I've tried all sorts of things, but nothing works. I thought maybe this would help."
Dr. Szozas looks at me for a moment before responding, "Mary Jane, do you have any idea how old you are?"
"Uh...21?" I reply.
He smiles again, and shakes his head, "No, I meant, what year is it right now? In what century?"
"...2020?" I answer hesitantly.
This time his smile widens into a big Cheshire cat grin, and his eyes sparkle, "Yes indeed! You're 21 years old, in the year 2020. That means that you were born in the late 1960s, and you'll turn 22 in 2023. Do you understand what I'm telling you, Mary Jane?"
I nod slowly, "I understand. I was born in 1969, which means I was 25 when I had my first child. She's 17, and she is very beautiful!"
I blush a little when I admit that aloud, and his eyes narrow a bit, "What happened after you got married, and then divorced, and remarried, and then had another child?"
I shrug, "I don't really want to talk about that. I'm not proud of what I did, and I wish I could go back and change the way my life turned out, but I can't."
"You aren't alone, Mary Jane," he states, and I frown. "I mean, you

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Daphne Wills. I've been seeing a therapist named Michael Szozas about an issue that I have."
He nods encouragingly, and then asks, "Tell me what happened?"
So I tell him about the situation that started this whole mess, which involved my husband cheating on me with another woman. I describe the affair, and I explain that I felt betrayed and angry.  Then I get into more details about how I feel, and the things I did after discovering that my husband was unfaithful. I don't know where to go from there, but Dr. Szozas just listens patiently. He doesn't interrupt or ask questions until I finish talking.
When I'm done, he gives a little nod, and says quietly, "That sounds very complicated, Daphne. It can be difficult to understand the dynamics between people when they are having affairs; I suspect that the two of them were probably trying to satisfy their own needs. But if you want to continue, I would recommend that you seek help in understanding the issues, both yours and your husband's.
It might help if we talk a bit more. Would you mind if I asked a few questions? I'd like to try and better understand the situation, and perhaps I'll learn something useful.
I consider his question, and I decide to give him a chance. I say, "Sure, I guess so. What do you need to know?"
Dr. Szozas responds, "Why didn't you confront your husband right away, and why didn't you report the infidelity?"
I shrug my shoulders, and I reply, "I had no idea if the situation really warranted confronting my husband...and I wasn't sure if I should even be telling anyone. I thought maybe I was imagining the problem, and I wanted to wait and see if anything else happened before I reported it. And I was afraid to call him, because I

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Denni Gurney."
He smiles kindly at me, then asks, "And why did you choose this particular therapist?"
It feels weird to say out loud, but I answer, "I've been having issues lately...and I thought maybe something was wrong with me. But I don't know what, exactly. And since I didn't want to go through all the trouble of finding another one, I just went online and looked up therapists specializing in 'unusual cases.'"
Dr. Szozas nods, and then asks, "Would you mind telling me about those problems? What specifically have you noticed recently?"
I do, and I tell him about my recent episodes, the ones where I feel compelled to kill myself, and how they seem to happen more often than before. He listens intently, nodding along at times, asking for clarification at others. When I finish, he looks at me for a long time, and I can't help wondering if he knows.
After a while, he speaks softly, "Tell me about the other side of things. Have you felt good, or bad, or neutral, or indifferent?"
I think for a moment, and I explain, "I guess I would describe it as a combination of both. Sometimes I feel really good, and sometimes I feel depressed, and I wonder if I should be feeling either way. I used to always feel better, and now I'm not sure if I'm doing any better. I'm still working on the depression, and I'm trying to figure out how to get rid of the suicidal urges."
Dr. Szozas leans back in his chair, his face thoughtful for a few moments, and then he asks, "What does the other part look like to you? Do you remember when it started, or when it ended?"
I pause for a second, and I consider the question, and I realize that I'm probably not the best person
