=== Prompt ========================================
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "

My name is Cian."
He nods, then asks, "What brings you to see me?"
"Well, um... after reading all those articles online..." I trail off, searching for words. "It sounds like there might be something wrong with me, but I can't tell what it is."
He smiles again, "You don't know? You've never felt different before now?"
"No. Not really. Well, yes, maybe a little bit. Like when I was younger, I used to get headaches sometimes, or feel dizzy when I got tired. But nothing too serious."
"How long have you had these symptoms?"
"Oh, umm, since I was about 11 years old. I think they started when I was in school. My parents thought it was just stress, because I always seemed to do well academically. And I did okay socially, though I wasn't popular with the girls. It was mostly boys who liked me. They would call me 'Cookie Monster'."
Dr. Szozas chuckles, "So, you were an oddball growing up, huh?"
I smile back at him, "Yeah, I guess so. When we moved to this town I didn't fit in any better than I had when I lived with my family. I still remember the first time I walked into the local high school. I stood out like a sore thumb. I'm not sure if it was the clothes I wore, or the way I talked, or the fact that I came from a small rural town where everyone knew everybody else, but I was the weirdest kid at the most prestigious private academy in the state. I was the only one without a cell phone or a laptop; I didn't even own a book until I went to college. I'm not sure if that's normal, but I couldn't imagine having to deal with people I didn't know when I needed to communicate. I had

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Abigail."  He looks surprised, "Abby? Abby?" He asks again, puzzled. I nod, "Yes."
"Well, Abby, this is very interesting. We have an abnormality here, which is why we've arranged for you to meet with us today. It may seem silly to say this, but I don't think there's anything wrong with you physically. You appear healthy enough, but then, I didn't get much information about you before coming in." He pauses, and continues, "You said you were feeling 'unsettled.' That's understandable, given the circumstances. How long has this been happening?"
"About three months now, I guess," I reply, thinking back to what happened yesterday afternoon. I remember getting home after work, and finding myself unable to concentrate on anything other than the strange sensation emanating from my body. It had started out small, like an itch or tickle, but by the time I got home, it felt more like an electric shock coursing through my nerves. The weirdest part was that I couldn't tell where the sensations originated. Sometimes they seemed to originate from within my chest cavity, sometimes they emanated from my feet. I tried to shake them off, but I just couldn't ignore them anymore. I'd gone to bed that night with the uncomfortable sensation still buzzing in my mind. I woke up the next morning with the same feelings, but stronger.
Dr. Szozas nods thoughtfully, "Hmm... that sounds about right. Have you ever experienced any similar symptoms before?"
I shook my head no, "No. I haven't even heard of such a thing!"
Dr. Szozas' face brightens, "That's good! I'm not sure how else to describe the experience, but I can assure you that it is real. I'll need to do some tests to determine exactly what is going on with you. I'm

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Elizabeth." My heart flutters at being called by her real name, such a sweet sound coming from this handsome doctor, "And I'm here because..." I pause again, trying to think what would best describe myself, "...because something isn't right."
He nods encouragingly, "Yes?"
Now it's time to tell him about my experience with the internet, "Well...it started last week, when I went online searching for information regarding depression. I came across one particular website that had been used to help others deal with their issues, and I began reading through it. It seemed very helpful, and I decided to try it out. The next day I felt much better than I did before, and I thought I was doing great. But then yesterday, things took a turn for the worse. I was feeling depressed again, but now I didn't know where to go to get help. I tried asking my friends, but they were all busy. They couldn't really spare any time to talk about personal problems with me, especially since we haven't even known each other that long. And I don't have anyone else to talk to, so I just kept thinking about it. That was when I found the web site I mentioned earlier. I read through the whole thing, and I saw that there was a section that talked about people experiencing unusual symptoms or conditions, and I figured that might be me. So I emailed the webmaster, hoping that I could meet with him, but I never heard back. So I emailed him a second time, but I still got no reply. I read the FAQs, but I wasn't sure if I should email the psychiatrist or not, but I knew I needed to find out if I am suffering from an unusual condition that the psychiatrists can treat. I hope that I am going about this the correct way."
Dr. Szozas leans forward, "Elizabeth, I am a professional. I am trained to be

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is James Jenson."
He nods slowly, "And why have you chosen to consult with me?"
"Well, uhm..." I stutter, embarrassed by this whole ordeal. "It all started last week...last Tuesday night actually. It was Halloween, and we had a party at our house, and everyone dressed up as their favorite horror movie character. My wife was playing 'Freddy Krueger,' and she was really good, she did an amazing job making herself seem so real. And then I decided to dress up too, because I wanted to try something new, maybe even go outside the box. I chose a Dracula costume, which I thought was pretty cool. But after I put it on, I realized that I couldn't move very well, and I was having trouble breathing. I didn't know what was happening until I went upstairs to get her a drink, and I found myself unable to walk properly, or talk without stumbling over words. When I got back downstairs, people were laughing at me, saying that they knew I was a fake, that I wasn't supposed to be able to do those things. I tried to explain, but no one would listen to me."
Dr. Szozas looks at me, "So, tell me more about that."
"That's when I called 911, but no ambulance came; instead, I ended up at the hospital. They kept me there overnight for observation, but when I woke up the next day I felt fine, except that I had no idea how I'd gotten home that evening. I asked the doctor about that, but he said that I just needed a few days to rest up, and that I wouldn't need to worry about that. He also suggested that I might want to consider seeing a psychiatrist about this strange experience that I've been through. I guess I don't think that I'm crazy, but I am concerned that I may be going insane. I feel like

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Rachel, and I've been experiencing odd symptoms recently."
He leans forward, "Tell me more about those symptoms."
So I tell him about waking up one morning feeling exhausted, and having trouble sleeping through the night, and then my nightmares starting again, and getting very confused during the day. And I start describing the dreams, which seem to have changed somewhat since last time. They aren't quite what they used to be, but now there are other things mixed in with them. It feels as though something else is trying to get out, to break free.  It doesn't feel pleasant, it just feels wrong. Like something is crawling inside of me, taking control.
Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding along as I describe each symptom. He asks questions occasionally, such as whether I had any thoughts of suicide lately, or if I'd ever experienced anything similar before.
When I finish telling him about my most recent dream, he looks up at me and smiles kindly, "Rachel, do you know where this is coming from?"
Oh, I think. Yes, I think I understand now. I try to explain, "No doctor, but it's not normal. Something is happening to me, changing me somehow. I don't want to hurt anyone, but I can't stop myself. I'm afraid that I might... I'm worried that I may..." I'm unable to say the words.
The psychiatrist reaches out to gently touch my shoulder, his smile growing wider, "You are a wonderful young woman, Rachel. You are a strong person, and I believe that you will be able to overcome whatever is troubling you. I am going to help you. I am going to work with you, and we are going to find out exactly what is causing all these problems. I promise that I'll be with you the whole way through, and I won't let you go until I am sure that you are completely safe

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Amy Jones." And then I explain myself: "I've been having problems lately...and I think they might have something to do with my dreams..."
He listens patiently, nodding occasionally. When I finish talking, he responds, "And what would those 'problems' consist of?"
"Well, um...well, it started last week after reading an article online about lucid dreaming, and I found myself doing things that were strange...like walking through walls or into other people's houses without permission...or being able to control other peoples minds, even though I can barely get mine to work right now..." I start to feel embarrassed, but he just smiles reassuringly, "That sounds normal enough, go ahead, continue."
So I proceed to tell him about the nightmares I've had recently, including one where I was standing outside of a house that looked exactly like our old place before we moved away. The door was open, and inside there was a woman lying in bed, naked except for her shoes. She didn't move when I walked into the room, she just lay there motionless. It took me a moment to realize that I was wearing only my underwear and socks, but I felt completely exposed. I tried to wake up, but I couldn't. I tried again and again, but I kept falling back asleep. I woke up a few times, but I always fell back asleep soon afterwards.
When I finished telling him, Dr. Szozas asked me, "Do you remember anything about the dream itself? What did the woman look like?"
"She was beautiful, with long black hair, big brown eyes, and a sweet smile. But I don't know if I'm describing the woman or the apartment that I saw in the dream, because I'm not sure which is more real to me. I keep thinking that the dream is going to be reality..."
Dr. Szozas listened to me intently, and nodded

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Emily Rose."  He nods, as if he understands what I said. "And I came here because..."
"You were reading online about 'unusual cases,' and thought this might apply to you?" He prompts.
"Yes, exactly," I say.
"What did you find? What got you interested?"
I explain what I found, and he listens intently, nodding occasionally, asking questions only when necessary. When I finish talking, he asks, "Do you feel any different today than yesterday?"
"No...yes, maybe a little more anxious."
"Anything else? Any other symptoms or feelings?"
"Not really, just a lot of thoughts running through my head. And I can't stop thinking about sex."
Dr. Szozas smiles again, and leans forward, "Sex?"
"Well, yes, but not in a bad way. It's just that ever since I started having those dreams, I've been feeling very sexual all day long. Like I want to masturbate constantly, but I don't have time to do it."
"So, let's talk about that for a moment," he begins. "When we meet with patients, we always start with a medical history. Do you know where to begin?"
I nod.
"Good, then tell me about your past medical history," he says.
This is the part I am most nervous about; I hate to lie, but I need to get to the truth. I tell him about the surgery I had when I was six years old, and how I was diagnosed with a cyst on the ovary that was removed, and I'm relieved when I hear myself saying the words. I'm even happier when I realize that I am telling the truth.
"That's good, that was a simple procedure, and a quick recovery. Now, I'm going to ask you a few personal questions that may seem a

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Daphne."
He nods encouragingly, "And why have you sought out this particular service?"
Oh boy... I've never had anyone ask me such questions before. It feels awkward, but also strangely freeing. I feel like I can finally tell him all about myself. And then I realize, what if he doesn't believe me? What if he thinks I'm crazy? That would ruin everything. My head spins with anxiety. But then again, maybe he'll think I'm just a little strange, and we can work together to find a solution. I decide to go ahead. "Well, I'm having trouble sleeping lately..."
"What do you sleep in?", he asks.
I shrug, "A regular bed."
He tilts his head, "Do you dream often?"
Again I shake my head, "Not really. Just sometimes when I wake up during the night. Like now. This morning when I woke up, I thought I heard something outside my window, but I didn't hear anything after that, and I fell back asleep. Then later I started dreaming, and I was walking along a street, there were people talking to me, but they weren't speaking English, but I understood them anyway because I knew their language, but I couldn't understand any words, only sounds. The voices seemed to be coming from everywhere, but I wasn't sure if I should listen to the voices or ignore them, but I kept hearing more and more of the same, until I realized that I was awake, and I felt a lot better about that than I did about the other thing. I went to the bathroom, brushed my teeth, got dressed, and came to the doctor's office. Now I'm sitting here waiting to talk to you about it. I hope that answers the question about the dreams. I don't know if that answers the question about the rest of it, but I'm hoping that I haven't been too

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Amy." I pause again, "and... uh..." My mind wanders, searching for something profound to say, and then I realize what I want to tell this good doctor. I feel silly saying it aloud, but I have to do it, "I think I've gone insane. I can't control myself anymore."
He sits there quietly for a moment before speaking, "Tell me more about that," he prompts gently.
So I start talking, telling him about my strange dreams, my visions, my erratic behavior. As I talk, I find myself becoming emotional, and I begin to cry. The tears flow freely now, and I don't know if they are because I'm really upset or because I'm embarrassed by my own weakness.
After I finish, he just stares silently at me for a while. He looks sad, sympathetic even. It makes me uncomfortable to be the center of attention. I shift uncomfortably on the sofa, trying to keep myself composed.
Finally he speaks, "Amy, let me ask you a question: are you happy?"
Oh boy, that sounds ominous. I look at him quizzically, wondering what he means. Is he asking me to define happiness? I decide to go with the flow, "Yes, I am very happy right now."
"Good girl, I'm glad to hear that. Now listen carefully; I need you to answer yes or no to each question that I ask you. If you choose not to answer a question, please wait until the end of the session before answering any other questions that may follow. Are we clear?"
I nod, still feeling a little nervous about the whole situation.
"Are you a virgin?"
Ugh! This is not the time for this conversation, I think, but I answer anyway. I don't want to be rude, but I also don't want to lie.
"No, I am not a virgin."


=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is ... uhm ..." My mind goes blank. What do I tell this guy? Why did I even bother coming here?
He smiles again, encouragingly, "Your full name?"
"Uhmm, okay, yeah."
"And why are you here?"
"Well, I've been having problems sleeping lately, and I wanted to talk to somebody about it."
He nods, "Is there anything else you want to discuss with me?"
Shit, what now? "Um... well, I don't know if this is something I should be talking to you about..."
He looks at me expectantly, "Why not?"
What can I say? I try to think back to all those times I had trouble falling asleep, and I come up empty handed. "It just feels inappropriate, somehow."
"Inappropriate?"
"Yeah. I feel silly telling you about this stuff, when we haven't met yet."
He laughs softly, "Silly? You are absolutely right. We have never spoken before today. How would you describe our relationship then?"
Oh God, I hate being put on the spot. But if I don't answer, I'll be admitting that I am indeed crazy. So I decide to go with the truth: "We're friends."
Dr. Szozas raises an eyebrow at me, "You are joking with me?"
"No!"
He sighs, "So you are serious about this 'inappropriateness', is that correct?"
I nod, feeling embarrassed.
He thinks for a moment, "Do you believe that I am qualified to treat you with respectability?"
"Yes!" I blurt out without thinking about it first. I'm sure that I am making an ass out of myself.
Dr. Szozas grins at me, "Then let's proceed with that assumption. I will ask you a series of questions that I hope
