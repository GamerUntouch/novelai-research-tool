So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him.

One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

As I speak, his eyebrows knit together as he listens intently, and then he asks, \"What do you feel now? Do you still have feelings associated with those dreams?\"\nI shake my head, \"No, not really. It was just a dream, nothing more than a dream.\"\nDr. Szazas nods knowingly, \"But there is another side to things, isn't there? What if we say that your waking life experiences are also part of the same dream, or perhaps even a different one entirely?\"\nI frown, \"That sounds crazy.\"\n\"It doesn't sound crazy to me; I find it very plausible,\" he responds, \"what is the other possibility? That you are actually experiencing two separate events, each with their own unique characteristics, but somehow related to each other?\"\n\"Are you saying that I'm dreaming, but awake at the same time?\"\n\"Yes, I am. You are currently asleep, but the dreams that you are experiencing are a form of self-hypnosis; a hypnotic state that is induced by the subconscious mind while you are sleeping. This is a common phenomenon; I've seen many patients with similar issues, where the patient is unaware that the hypnosis is occurring, but the results are quite impressive.\"\n\"I don't know, I'm pretty sure I'm fully conscious the whole time, and I'm aware that I'm talking to you, but I can't deny that I'm seeing things that are happening elsewhere at the same time.\"\n",

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

It's when people hear voices inside their heads telling them to do things they know aren't right or normal.\"\nThat explained it all, and I felt better. But then I thought, \"What if I just don't want to go crazy?\"\nSo I went to a doctor, a psychiatrist, who prescribed medication to help calm me down, and that seemed to work. Until today. Today, I'm hearing strange noises inside my head, and I can't control myself. And I'm afraid that if this doesn't stop soon, I might hurt someone or something.\nDr. Szozas listens intently to my story, nodding occasionally. He asks questions about my past history, and I answer honestly.
