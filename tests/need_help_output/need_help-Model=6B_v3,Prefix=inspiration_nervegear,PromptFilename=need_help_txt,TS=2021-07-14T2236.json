  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

  "result": "My name is Alice Zuberg... uh...\"\nHe nods encouragingly, waiting patiently for me to continue.\n\"...and I'm here because I have been experiencing strange thoughts lately.\"\nThat sounds pretty vague to me, too. But Dr. Szozas doesn't say anything else, just sits there silently watching me. It's hard to know where to begin, but I decide to start by describing what happened last night, while we were walking back home from dinner.\nIt all started after we finished eating. We walked across campus together, chatting about schoolwork, sports teams, other people we knew. When we reached our dorm building, we parted ways: I went inside to get ready for bed, and he continued on to his own room. That was when things got weird.\nWhen I closed the door to my room, I found myself thinking about something that had nothing to do with me or anyone else in this world. I was suddenly transported away to another place, a peaceful landscape dotted with small white houses. The scene before me seemed very familiar somehow, though I couldn't put a finger on exactly how. There was an old woman standing outside her house, dressed in the traditional clothing worn by many women throughout history. She looked up at me with a smile that spoke volumes of happiness. Her face shone with a light that I recognized, and I felt a sudden sense of warmth toward the image of the smiling woman.\nAt that moment, I heard a voice coming from somewhere nearby, \"Welcome to the village of Rulid. How may I help you?\"\nThe voice came again, \"Who are you? What are you doing here?!\"\nThe voice belonged to a man that I didn't recognize; I turned to find that the speaker stood right beside me, his arms folded defiantly.\n\"What are you talking about?! This is MY land!\"\nThe man grabbed at his chest with both hands, \"This is not yours! You",

What do you mean by 'explode'? Is it painful?\"\n\"No, not really. Just sort of...sudden. Like something inside me just burst open.\"\n\"Hmm. Well, let's talk about that. Let's go back to where you were last night, when you discovered the log-in screen and realized that you had been hacked.\"\nSo I tell him the story, starting with getting home after work yesterday afternoon and logging in to find that I'd somehow ended up in a game called Gun Gale Online. At that point I was still trying to figure out what happened, but when I looked at the clock, it said 4:00 AM. And it occurred to me that I hadn't actually slept yet.\nDr. Szozas listens intently throughout, nodding occasionally. When I finish telling him the whole tale, he asks, \"Did you try to log-out or shut-down the console at any point during that period?\"\n\"...Not that I recall.\" I shake my head. \"It wasn't until I went to bed that I even noticed that I couldn't log-back in.\"\n\"That is curious. Did you ever play GGO with a friend or other player? Perhaps a guildmate, perhaps someone else online at the same time?\"\n\"Nope. I've never played with anyone but Asuna,\" I reply, feeling more confident now that I know I haven't cheated. \"I don't remember playing with anyone at all except that one person I talked to briefly at the bar...\"\n\"",

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

Do you have any symptoms? If so, please tell me what they are.\"\n\"No, not really. It's just this feeling inside that something isn't right.

I think there might be other people who feel the same way, or even worse off than I am, but we don't know each other, so I've been searching online for information about others who felt similarly.

The story is about a VRMMORPG that allows players to log into their own avatars and fight monsters and explore dungeons.

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

I feel like they would say something stupid like, \"You have been having trouble sleeping lately, haven't you?\"\nBut I don't want to sound dumb or uneducated. So instead, I answer simply, \"Well...it just seemed like I needed help...\"\nDr. Szozas nods again, slowly, as if digesting what I said. He looks back at me, and asks gently, \"Do you know what a 'soul' is?\"\n\"A soul...? Well, yes, I think so...\"\n\"What do you understand by the term 'soul' ? How much do you believe that your own individual self is defined by your body, and what you can touch with your hands?\"\n\"...Um...\"\n\"For example, let's suppose that I were to cut off both your arms right now. Would you still consider yourself to be the same person that you are today?\"\nI start to panic a little at the thought, but I steel myself to remain calm and speak up, \"No...that wouldn't be me anymore.\"\n\"And yet, there are many humans out there who are unable to accept that fact.

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

Finally, I blurt out, \"And I want to kill myself.\"\nThere is another pause, and then Dr. Szozas laughs softly, \"Oh boy...\"\n* * *\nIt took me about thirty minutes before I finally understood what had happened. It was almost as if I were watching a movie where all the characters kept talking past each other without understanding what was being said by their neighbors. When I thought back on our conversation, I realized that I hadn't actually stated any facts or asked questions. I just blurted them out, hoping they would somehow connect together in a meaningful way.\nDr. Szozas was patient throughout my ramblings. As I talked, he sat quietly listening, nodding occasionally. But when I finished speaking, he didn't say anything right away. Instead, he just stared off into space, lost in thought, while I waited anxiously for his reaction.\nFinally, he looked at me with a smile that seemed to contain both relief and sadness, \"Aha!\" He exclaimed suddenly. \"You've been through a lot, haven't you?\"\n\"Yes, I have,\" I agreed.\n\"So let me ask you: do you think there is a chance that the reason you feel that way is because of something that happened to you? Something that really messed up your head a little bit?\"\n\"...No. I don't believe that's the case.\"\n\"Then we can rule out most of the possible causes for depression. If that's not the problem, then the next question is whether the symptoms that you describe are part of a larger pattern that might be connected to some kind of psychological disorder that needs further study.\n\"If that's true, then I'd recommend that you come to the hospital tomorrow",
