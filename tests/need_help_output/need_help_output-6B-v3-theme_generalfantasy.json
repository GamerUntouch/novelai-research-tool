Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

Do you feel safe talking with me?\" he asks gently.\n\"Yes,\" I nod slowly, \"but I don't know if this is really a good idea. I've never had therapy before, and I don't even know where to start.\"\nHe smiles again, \"It can be difficult to get started sometimes, especially if one hasn't been involved with counseling before. But once we do get started, things will go much more smoothly than they did last time, when you were trying to figure out whether or not you should visit a doctor in the first place. Please tell me what brought you here today?\"\nSo I try to explain, \"Last week I was reading through the web pages about unusual cases, and I came across a site that said there was an expert psychiatrist nearby that specializes in such issues. When I looked up 'Dr. Michael Szosas', I found out that he lives right here in town, and I thought maybe I'd stop by to ask if he might be willing to help me with whatever I need to deal with. I guess I just didn't expect to find anyone who would be willing to meet with me at all.\"\nDr. Szozas laughs softly, \"Let me be clear: I'm not a licensed therapist; I am a trained counselor. I am a professional who helps people to work through their problems. My job is to listen, to be supportive, to be a sounding board, to help you explore your feelings, and to provide guidance as needed.
