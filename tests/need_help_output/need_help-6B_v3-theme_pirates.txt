=== Prompt ========================================
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "

=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Baret Ellington."
He nods, "And why did you contact me?"
Oh god... What do I tell this guy? I don't want to scare him off. But then again, I think he might already know something. I decide to just lay it all out there. "Well, I've been having a lot of trouble lately. My life is falling apart, and I'm not really sure what to do about it."
He raises one eyebrow, "That sounds serious. Why don't we start by talking about your symptoms: Have you noticed any changes in mood or behavior recently?"
I nod, "Yeah, I have. Like a couple weeks ago I started getting very depressed, and couldn't seem to get out of bed. It got worse until I finally had to go back to work. Since then I haven't felt right, and I can't sleep properly at night. I'm exhausted during the day, and I feel worn out and tired most of the time. And I keep thinking about things that aren't real, like people dying, and stuff. I'm not sure if it's because of stress at work, or maybe I need to talk about it with somebody."
Dr. Szozas leans forward, "OK, I understand that you are feeling anxious about something, but I would caution against jumping to conclusions that this is related to a psychological disorder such as depression. I suggest that you seek help from a professional counselor before making a diagnosis based solely on your own personal feelings."
I shrug, "Ok, I guess I'll try that. I was hoping that I'd find an expert to ask questions to figure this out, but I didn't expect to meet a psychiatrist who specializes in unusual cases."
Dr. Szozas smiles, "Yes, I specialize in unusual cases. I deal with a wide variety of problems, including those that are not diagnosed. I will be happy to answer any questions

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Emerald Berington."
He nods, "And what brings you to see me?"
I tell him the whole story, including all the details of my life before coming to Jamaica, and then we get onto my current situation. He listens patiently while I describe my problems. I feel like I've been talking forever, but finally I finish telling him about the nightmares. He sits silently, listening intently, nodding occasionally, asking questions now and again, "Do you think this has anything to do with what happened to you back home?"
"Yes sir, I have dreams almost nightly where I'm being chased by people, and they want to kill me. Sometimes they try to choke me, sometimes they stab me with knives, and other times..." I trail off.
Dr. Szozas looks concerned, "What happens during the day? Do you ever act out in any way?"
"No, nothing like that...just these awful nightmares, and waking up feeling sick to my stomach."
"Have you had any trouble sleeping lately?"
"Well, yes sir, I guess I haven't gotten much sleep since I came to Jamaica. It's just too hot and humid. My room is pretty cool though, I can usually go to bed early if I stay there until I pass out."
"Did you check into a hotel when you arrived?"
"Yeah, I stayed at the Marriott, but I couldn't get a good night's rest there either. I'm used to the climate at home, but I don't know if I'll be able to adjust to the heat and humidity here."
"So, how long were you at the Marriott, Emerald?"
"About two weeks, I guess."
"That sounds about right, I would say that's a reasonable amount of time to acclimate to a new place. And did you find the accommodations satisfactory?"
"Uh huh, I really liked the room, but

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Emerald Beringette." My heart races as I say it aloud, because this isn't really happening, right? Right? I close my eyes, trying to get control of myself, and then open them again, taking a deep breath before continuing, "And I came here today because I have... issues." The last word hangs heavily between us.
Dr. Szozas leans forward in his chair, "Tell me more about those 'issues.'"
So I start talking, telling him all about what happened to me since I started working aboard the Black Pearl. He nods along sympathetically, asking questions when appropriate, and giving advice when asked. He also tells me that we should talk about some things after our session together.
After about an hour or so, I feel pretty much back to normal, and I thank Dr. Szozas and leave his office. It feels good to be able to walk out of there without having tears running down my face.
When I arrive home, I check my email, and find a message from Dr. Szozas:
Hello Emerald,
You were a very brave young woman to come and visit me. I can tell by your demeanor that you are a strong person, but I'm afraid I didn't quite understand the nature of your problems until now.
It appears that the cause of your problem is your mother's death. I think that if she had lived a little longer, you would not be suffering the way that you are now. In fact, I suspect that if you hadn't been born, your father wouldn't be the man that he is.
Your father is a man that I've known for many years, and I know that he loves you deeply. I'm sure that he wants to do something about the situation that you are experiencing, but I'm not certain that I can help him. I don't want to give false hope, but I will try to contact your father later

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Beckett Berington."
He nods and smiles, "And why are you here?"
I start again, "I don't know..." I try to think of something profound or insightful to say, but nothing comes.
"Becky? What do you want to talk about?" He asks kindly, and gives me time to decide.
What can I tell this good doctor? It doesn't matter what I say now, because whatever I say will change the course of our relationship forever. I have to get through this somehow...
"Well... umm... I've been having trouble sleeping lately, and I thought maybe there was something wrong with me..." I mumble nervously.
"Oh dear. Well, we'll just start with getting you started then, alright Becky?" He asks, leaning forward to rest his elbows on his knees, clasping his hands together.
I nod, "OK..."
Dr. Szozas leans back in his chair, his head cocked slightly to one side, waiting patiently for me to continue.
I swallow hard, and close my eyes tightly before I begin speaking. "It all began about two weeks ago. I was lying awake late at night when I heard a noise outside the bedroom window. I went to investigate and I saw the silhouette of a person standing near the window. I screamed at them, but they disappeared into the darkness. The next morning I woke up with a splitting headache, but I didn't remember anything about the previous evening. I looked out the window, but I couldn't find any sign of anyone out there. I decided to go to bed early that night, but when I got to the room I found that the window had been left open. I'm not sure if I closed it myself or it fell shut by itself, but I'm pretty certain that I never opened it after that point. I lay awake that night, but I still felt uneasy. I tried to sleep

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My full name is Baret Emeraldine Morgan, I'm twenty years old, and..." I trail off, and I don't know where to go next.
He responds with another smile, "Go ahead."
"Well... I've been having problems with my life lately. My girlfriend dumped me last week, she said she wasn't happy anymore, and now I can't seem to find any new girlfriends. I went through this whole phase when I was younger, and I had to change schools three times because everyone knew what was happening between us. I thought we were meant to be together forever, but then one day she just left me without saying anything. It really hurt, and I tried to convince myself that maybe there was something wrong with her, but deep inside I knew that I'd done something to push her away. Now I feel lost, I want to do something different, but I have no idea what that would even be. I want to get back into school again, but I keep thinking about all the trouble I caused before, and I'm afraid to try it again. But I need help."
Dr. Szozas nods his head slowly, "Do you think that you might be depressed?"
"No, not exactly. I'm not sure if I am or not, but I am feeling a lot of stress lately, I guess I am stressed out. I am also very anxious, I am always worrying about things that I shouldn't be. I am worried about making mistakes, I worry about getting fired from jobs I hate, I worry about being poor, and I am nervous about talking to people. I am scared to talk to anyone, and I am constantly second guessing myself. I am doing everything I can to avoid conflict, I am trying to be a good person but I am failing miserably at it, and I am terrified that I am going to screw up my life. I am not sure if I am a bad person or a

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My full name is Baret Larkin."
He smiles again, "So tell me what brings you to me today?"
I try to explain myself: "Well, I've been having... issues lately..." My words trail off because I feel embarrassed saying them aloud. It feels strange to say them out loud, even though I know they're true. But then he nods knowingly, "You have been experiencing symptoms of depression."
"Yes," I admit.
"Have there been any other problems recently? Stressors perhaps? Any relationship changes or difficulties?" he asks gently.
I shake my head slowly.
"Are you currently taking medication?"
"No," I answer honestly.
"Then let's get started. Are you ready to talk about what might be bothering you?" he inquires softly.
"Sure," I reply, trying to gather my thoughts before diving into this.
"Tell me about your childhood, if you would," he directs.
I think back to my early years, growing up in New York City, "It was good," I begin cautiously, wondering where the conversation will go next.
"Did you ever experience bullying or teasing by others? Did you ever act out against another child, physically or verbally?"
I nod, remembering a time when I threw a rock at a girl who had made fun of me, but I don't really want to discuss that.
"Were you bullied at school, teased, ridiculed, made to feel inferior?"
That one I can't lie about. I remember being called names, especially at the beginning of the year when I was new to the class. I hated it at the time, but I learned to accept it after a while.
"Do you recall when the bullying stopped, and when things got better between you and the bully?"
Again I nod, feeling more relaxed now that we are getting into the subject matter. I'll be honest with him, I decide

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Baret."
He nods, waiting patiently. I continue, "And I've been having some issues..." I pause again, gathering my thoughts before continuing, "I think I may have become delusional recently. It started last week after I had this dream where... I saw myself standing outside a building, wearing a black trench coat, white gloves, holding a gun."
Dr. Szozas tilts his head slightly, "What do you mean by 'standing'? Were you inside or out?"
I explain further, "No, I was actually there, but I was standing next to the building. And then I heard a voice saying something along the lines of: "Don't move." I thought I was dreaming at the time, but now I know it wasn't a dream, because I was really there. The voice said that if I moved, they would shoot me dead right away. But I didn't want to die, so I stayed still. After a few minutes, the voice came back and repeated itself, "Do not move. Do not move. Do not move." Over and over again, until finally I realized that the voice was talking to me through a loudspeaker. When the voice stopped speaking, I woke up."
Dr. Szozas looks at me with his warm smile and asks, "Have you ever experienced anything similar before? Have any other dreams that seem real to you, or that feel like they might be true?"
"Well, no. Not exactly. I remember the exact date that I had the dream. I can't tell you the exact day, but I remember the month, and the year. That's all I can say about that."
Dr. Szozas leans forward, his face serious, his eyes focused on mine, "Baret, are you familiar with the concept of déjà vu?"
I nod my head yes, though I'm unsure what that means.
Dr

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Emerald Beryl Smith."  He smiles broadly again, and then asks, "And what brings you to see me?"
Well, there's more than one reason. First off, I want to know what's wrong with me. Secondly, I have this feeling that something terrible will happen if I don't get help soon, and thirdly...well, I just can't stop thinking about how much I've enjoyed being naked lately, especially when I was masturbating myself last night, and that makes me feel good. And fourthly, I want to find out if I can have sex with men. My boyfriend doesn't seem interested anymore, and I'd really rather not go back home if I don't need to. I'm afraid that I'll end up doing something stupid and embarrassing if I stay here any longer.
Dr. Szozas listens intently to what I say, and responds, "Thank you, Emerald. You said all those things very nicely." He pauses, and looks at me thoughtfully. After a moment, he continues, "You mentioned that you wanted to find out if you can have sex with men? Why do you think that might be important?"
So I tell him about my boyfriend, and about the fact that I'm attracted to other guys now. I also explain that I'm worried that I'm losing control of myself, that I may be acting strangely. Dr. Szosas nods along, listening attentively to everything I have to say. When I finish talking, he sits silently for several minutes before responding, "Can I ask you some questions?"
"Sure!" I reply.
"Have you ever had sexual feelings toward another person, even though they were a member of the same gender as you?" he inquires.
"Yes, but I'm not gay, or bi-sexual, or anything like that," I answer.
"What about masturbation, do you enjoy that?"
I

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My full name is Baret Wainwright." I pause, then add, "And I came because..." I have trouble finding the words... I want to say 'because I need help.' But I don't know what to say. I feel ashamed, embarrassed. I start again, trying to explain myself more clearly. "Because I think something is wrong with me." My hands shake slightly, I can't stop them.
Dr. Szozas smiles gently at me, "Go ahead," he encourages, "tell me all about it."
So I do. I tell him about my strange dreams, the things I've been doing, the way I talk to people, the oddities of my behavior. I try to give him as much information as possible, hoping that this will lead us somewhere.
He listens intently, nodding his head slowly, and taking notes on his laptop computer. When I finish, he looks up at me, "You're right," he nods his agreement, "you are experiencing a variety of symptoms that suggest unusual brain activity. You seem to be having a form of sleep paralysis, which is common among those with Asperger's Syndrome. Sleep paralysis occurs when one experiences vivid hallucinations during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. The fact that the episodes are occurring while awake is a sign that they are occurring outside of normal sleep patterns. This is also consistent with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. It sounds to me like you are experiencing the onset of a new stage of development, or perhaps a regression. In either case, I'd recommend that we schedule a series of sessions to discuss the issues that are causing the stress to your body."
The doctor gets to his feet, and I stand too; I'm a little surprised that I'm not sitting back down. He walks to the door, opens it, and gestures for me to follow him. We walk through a door, into a hallway, and he turns to me,

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Eileen Bekinney." The room grows quiet except for our breathing, then Dr. Szozas speaks again, "And why are you here?"
I feel myself getting flustered, but I try to compose myself before answering, "Well...it's just..." My mind wanders off onto other things. It doesn't seem right to tell this man all my secrets. What would I even say? I'm not sure if I can trust him yet, after all, I don't know anything about him. But he said he specializes in unusual cases, maybe there will be something helpful here? "It's just that...well, I've been having dreams lately where I have sex with people I don't want to sleep with, and when I wake up they're gone. And I get confused when I go to the bathroom because sometimes when I pee I think I hear voices talking to me or singing songs, and when I'm with friends I keep thinking about them naked. Sometimes I smell perfume or cologne on a guy who isn't wearing any, and I find myself thinking dirty thoughts. I'm not sure what's happening to me."
Dr. Szozas smiles broadly at me, "You certainly are a fascinating young lady!" His face turns serious now, "Do you recall the first time that you had a sexual experience with a man?"
The question catches me by surprise, "Um...no, I guess I wouldn't really remember that either. I was pretty young, probably eleven years old, but I do vaguely remember the man. He was a friend of a family member, a neighbor, I believe his name was Alan, but I was too scared to ask questions about him." I pause to consider if I should mention that I masturbated to the memory, but decide against it.
Dr. Szozas nods, "That makes sense. You were a shy child, perhaps a little anxious about the prospect of
