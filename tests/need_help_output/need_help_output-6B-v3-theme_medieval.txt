My name is Rebecca Winters."
He nods, "And where do you live?"
"In San Diego County, California."
"Do you have any family there? Children? Parents?"
"No, none of those things apply. No children, and only one parent: her name is Marjorie Winters."
He sits back, and then asks, "What brings you to our offices today?"
"Well, I've been having problems sleeping lately..."
"Tell me more about this sleep problem."
So I tell him all about the nightmares, and how they started after the accident, and how I can't seem to get rid of them...and I don't know if it's just because of the painkillers or what, but the dreams are getting worse. And I mention that I went online to find a doctor, and I mentioned Dr. Szazas by name.
Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding, "How long ago did you start experiencing the difficulties with sleep?"
"About two months now."
"Have you had difficulty falling asleep before?"
"Yes, but not nearly to the extent that I am now."
"Are you taking any medications that might be causing these problems with your sleep?"
"Not that I am aware of."
"Has anyone else noticed that you are having trouble sleeping?"
"My parents say I haven't slept well since the accident, but I didn't realize that was a medical issue until recently."
"Was the accident itself traumatic, perhaps a car wreck, maybe a fire, something that caused the injury to your head that is keeping you awake at night?"
"It was a car crash. I was driving home from work, and I was hit by another vehicle. It was a total surprise, I was thrown through the windshield, I remember seeing the glass explode into thousands of tiny pieces, I was trapped inside the passenger compartment, but somehow I managed

My name is Kristin." And then I wait again while he studies me, and he asks, "And why have you come?"
"Um... because..." My face flushes hot with embarrassment, "because I think something might be wrong with me."
He nods slowly, "Well, let's start there."
So we talk for awhile, mostly about me and my family. It turns out that I've been seeing this psychologist since childhood. Apparently, I had trouble coping with stressors in school, and one day I just started talking to myself, which led to other problems. When I was 18 years old, I got married, but I found it difficult to cope with my husband after a few months, so I left him. After that, I dated a lot, and I would often get depressed when things didn't work out between us. But I never sought professional help until now.
Dr. Szozas listens patiently to all of this, nodding occasionally as I speak. We discuss what medications I'm taking, and how they affect me. I tell him about the side effects, and that I'd rather not be medicated if possible. "Is there anything else that might cause you to feel unhappy or sad or anxious? Are you feeling suicidal?"
I shake my head no to both questions, "No, I don't want to die, but I do wish I were dead sometimes."
"Do you ever hear voices inside your head, or see visions or strange images or symbols or patterns or words that seem meaningful or important?"
"Yes, I guess I do at times," I admit.
"Have you ever experienced any traumatic events, either physically or emotionally, that may have caused you harm or pain?"
"Oh yes, I have many memories that are painful," I confess. I am thinking about my mother dying when I was 8, and her leaving me with an abusive stepfather, and I try to explain that I am

My name is Elizabeth Kristine, and I've been seeing Dr. Szozas since June."
He nods slowly, taking this all in, and then he asks, "What do you think is happening?"
Oh boy, here we go. What should I say? How can I explain this without sounding crazy? Should I just tell him what I know? No, wait... maybe there is something else I haven't tried yet. Maybe there is another way.
So I ask, "Dr. Szozas, have you ever heard of the term 'telekinesis'?"
That stops him cold, "No, never heard of it before now. Please continue."
"Well, I'm having trouble controlling my body functions, specifically, I seem unable to move my arms or legs. It started after I watched one of those movies where they show people using their minds to lift objects off the ground, and I thought I might try doing that myself. But when I tried to lift an object, nothing happened. And I didn't realize that I had stopped breathing until I felt my heart pounding against my chest, which caused me to start again, and that was very frightening because I don't remember if I'm supposed to be able to breathe while I'm asleep..."
Dr. Szozas is nodding along with me, listening intently, "Yes, yes, I understand, that sounds exactly like the symptoms I'm familiar with," he responds with a smile. "And I'm wondering if I could get a history from you about the events that led up to the onset of these problems. Can I please have a copy of the email I sent to you about a week ago?"
I nod, "Of course, I'll send a PDF file with the information you requested."
"Excellent, thank you, I appreciate that. Now, I'd like to begin by asking a few questions. When did the problem first manifest itself?"
"

My name is Kristin." And then I pause again, because I don't know where to start. It feels strange to have this conversation with another person. The way things are now, there is just too much between us.  It doesn't feel right to talk about anything personal or intimate. But I'm not sure what else to do...
He looks at me expectantly, waiting for more details. I try to gather my thoughts before speaking further: "Well..."
"Kristin?" he prompts.
"Yes, I guess I should tell you about myself first."
"OK, go ahead."
So I begin telling him about my life story. How I was raised by two loving parents, until they divorced when I was 15 years old. That I had a pretty normal childhood, except for the fact that I was always sickly; I never really got any good grades in school, even though I tried hard to get them. My mother died when she was 39, after battling breast cancer for five long years; her death devastated me. I went through a period of depression, and that led to drug use. For the past several months, I've been getting clean, but the experience left me feeling empty inside, without hope.
Then I met the woman I fell in love with, and we started dating. She helped me to realize that I need to find something positive in my life, that I can't live only for myself. I need to focus on others, not just on me. I also realized that I need to learn how to be happy with the people I'm with.
"That sounds very promising!" exclaims Dr. Szozas, "you seem to be doing quite well, given the circumstances. What brought about the change? Were the drugs part of the problem, or is the breakup the cause?"
"Both," I reply honestly.
"Hmmmmm," he ponders the matter for a moment, "

My name is... um..."
He interrupts me, "Your name is?"
"Kristi."
"And what brings you to our little clinic today, Kristi? Are you having trouble sleeping?"
"No, actually, I've been feeling fine until this morning. But now I just feel really strange, like something isn't right with me."
"OK, let's start there then. How do you feel physically?"
"Fine, except I have a headache, which is odd because I don't normally get headaches. And also I had diarrhea yesterday, and it took forever to go away. It was horrible, I almost threw up, but I didn't want to leave work early. Oh, and I'm hungry all the time, too, even though I only ate half an apple last night. And I'm thirsty, but I can't drink much water without getting sick again."
Dr. Szozas nods, and he asks, "How long have you felt off lately?"
"Well, I guess since Friday, when I went to work. Before that I was doing great, but then things started to change on Saturday. On Sunday, after I got home from church, I woke up and I couldn't stop shaking; I kept thinking about my mother dying, and I knew that I wanted to die, but I wasn't sure what to do about it. So I tried to kill myself with a knife, but I stopped before I did anything bad enough to end up in the hospital. So I drove to the emergency room at the hospital, but they wouldn't admit me because I hadn't cut deep enough. So I left and came to you, but I'm still not sure if I should be admitted. I'm scared that I'll hurt someone. I'm trying to decide what I'm going to do, or maybe I'm already dead, and I just haven't realized it yet. I think I might be schizophrenic,

My name is Kate." My heart races as I say this because I've never been called by my given name before. It feels strange to hear myself speak in such a formal manner, and I feel awkward as I continue, "I came today to get help regarding some things I have recently noticed."
He nods, "Go ahead..."
"Well, I'm noticing... changes in my body. Changes that aren't normal, I guess. And then there's also something else happening inside my head, where I'm having trouble focusing, or concentrating. There's just too much stuff coming at me all the time, and I can't keep up anymore."
"Kate, what do you mean when you talk about 'changes?'"
I pause again, trying to figure out exactly how to describe them. "It's hard to explain, really. But I'll try: When I go swimming or walking outside, I start to shake. Like I'm cold or scared, but when I touch myself later, nothing happens. Sometimes I even think that I might be pregnant. That doesn't happen often, though. The other day I was at home, watching TV, and suddenly I felt sick to my stomach. I couldn't eat anything after that. I haven't had any morning sickness yet, but I am worried about it. I don't know if I should tell anyone about these symptoms, but I want to be sure I'm not imagining things. They are getting worse with each passing week, I think." I look at Dr. Szozas, and I sense that I am making an impression on him, "That's pretty much everything that I can remember right now."
Dr. Szozas pauses to consider me for a moment, "OK, let me ask some questions, OK? You said that you are noticing these changes, but that they are not necessarily abnormal. Can you give me a list of the things that you are experiencing?"
"Sure,

My name is Katherine Elizabeth Andrews." My gaze falls downward, unable to meet this man's eyes. This isn't right. Why did I agree to this? What does he want? Is there something wrong with me? The questions flood through my mind, but all I can do is wait, and hope he will tell me what he wants to know.
He leans forward, placing both hands flat onto his knees, "Katherine, please don't worry about anything. Just relax, and let us talk. Tell me where you live?"
I nod slowly, taking another deep breath, trying to calm myself down. I have never been in such a situation before, and I really didn't expect to find myself here today. But now that I've agreed to go through with it, I feel compelled to follow through.
Dr. Szozas nods, "Good, good, fine. Now, we'll start by asking you some simple questions, and then we'll move into more complex ones. You are free to leave at any time if things aren't working out for you, or if you just need a break. If that happens, I promise not to bother you again until next week. Do you understand?"
Again I nod yes, "OK."
"Now, I'm going to ask you a series of questions, and I'd like to hear your answers. I am also interested in your responses to those questions. Please answer honestly. I won't get angry with you, but I may become disappointed with the way you answer, and I'm sure I will be surprised at times."
"Yes sir, I understand," I reply.
"Do you believe that God created the world?"
"No."
"Why is that?"
"Because it's absurd. That would imply that everything was made up at once, with no purpose at all. It doesn't make sense."
"What is the meaning of life?"
"To be

My name is Rebecca Smith, and..." I pause, unsure how to proceed, then continue, "...and I've been having strange feelings lately."
He nods encouragingly, "Yes?"
I continue hesitantly, "Well, I don't know exactly what they are, but...the last few days have felt different somehow. Like something is wrong with me, or there's something wrong with me, but I can't put my finger on it." I trail off, glancing away from his gaze, feeling embarrassed by this admission.
Dr. Szozas nods again, "And do you feel better after doing whatever it is you did?"
"No," I admit, "It doesn't seem to help."
He smiles sympathetically, "That sounds very similar to my own experience. Do you mind if I ask you a couple questions? They will not require any personal information or divulge anything private about you, only the facts."
I nod my head, "Sure, go ahead."
"You say that you were experiencing 'strange feelings', but nothing specific? Any particular sensations or emotions that might describe them more specifically?"
"Um, I guess maybe just a general sense of unease. It was hard to pin down."
Dr. Szozas nods thoughtfully, "What about when you were younger, before you started college, did you ever suffer from mental health issues that would cause you to behave differently than normal?"
"Oh no, I was always pretty well behaved."
Dr. Szozas raises an eyebrow at me, and asks, "So you never had a problem with anxiety or depression?"
I shake my head emphatically, "Nope. Not that I'm aware of anyway. Why, do you think that I'm suffering from some sort of psychiatric disorder?"
He chuckles, "Not at all. My question was simply meant to be rhetorical -- I'm trying to determine whether the reason

My name is Kaitlin Dufosset."
He smiles broadly, "You can call me Mike, please do," he offers kindly.
Now I feel silly. I've never been called by my last name before, let alone just 'Mike.' But I don't want to seem ungrateful, or disrespectful. So I say, "Thank you, Mike."
"So tell me what brings you here today?"
It feels strange to have this stranger ask me questions about myself. I answer hesitantly, "Well, uh... I guess I'm not really sure where to start..."
"That sounds fine to me," he chuckles softly, "let's begin at the beginning shall we? You were referred to me because of your symptoms. Tell me about them," he asks gently.
I think back to all the things that have happened since I started school: the nightmares, the panic attacks, the feeling of being watched, the voices in my head telling me to kill people, and then the memory flashes of my parents' death. It all came flooding back into me when I thought about what was happening to me. "This is crazy!" I exclaim, standing up from the couch.
Dr. Szozas stands up too, taking a few steps towards me, "Kaitlin, calm down," he commands calmly. I stop moving, but I'm shaking.
Dr. Szozas sits again, and I'm still. He looks at me intently, waiting for me to continue. I try to collect my thoughts.
"OK, well... I'm having dreams about killing people, or monsters, and they wake me up screaming. I'm afraid to go to sleep at night. I'm seeing visions of things that aren't there, but are very real to me, and I'm hearing voices that are trying to convince me to hurt other people. I'm losing weight rapidly, I'm getting headaches constantly,

My name is Vivien Sorensen." It feels strange saying this aloud; the words seem foreign coming out of my mouth, even though they sound perfectly normal.
He nods. "And tell me more about yourself, Vivian?"
So I do. The story comes spilling out: My husband, Brad, had been having problems with our marriage, especially after we were married. We hadn't been together long before getting pregnant, which led to us moving in together. But then things got worse, and now we barely speak to each other. He spends all his time working, leaving little room for me. He doesn't pay attention to me anymore, except when he needs something. He doesn't listen to what I have to say, and he just pushes me away when I try to talk to him. And there are times where I feel like I don't know who I am any longer... I've become a stranger to myself. I find myself feeling sorry for myself sometimes, wondering if there was ever anything good about me. When I get depressed, I can't help but think about suicide; I wonder if anyone will miss me when I die.
Dr. Szozas listens intently to my story, nodding occasionally. "Is that all? You haven't mentioned any symptoms or signs yet."
"No, I guess not..." I mumble.
"Well, let's start with the basics. Do you remember when you first started noticing changes in your life, or perhaps a change in personality? What triggered it?"
I pause. "It's hard to pinpoint exactly, but I think I noticed a few years ago, maybe five or six years ago, that I wasn't happy with the way I looked. I thought I needed to lose weight, but I didn't want to go to the gym, I hated the idea of being seen exercising, I wanted to stay home and eat junk food. I would watch TV, and I'd snack
