=== Prompt ========================================
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "

=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Astrid Rosemary Parker." My hands rest on my lap, palms flat against each other, "And I don't know why I'm here."
He looks at me curiously, "So...you've never been diagnosed with anything?"
"No." I reply, slowly shaking my head side to side, "At least, not by anyone that I can remember. It's just always felt normal to me..."
Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair, "Well then, let's start with what brought you to my office today? What do you want to talk about?"
It feels strange talking to this stranger, but I begin telling him all about my life thus far, my family history, my childhood, my career goals, etcetera. He nods along, asking questions, and occasionally offering an opinion or two. And while we speak, I realize that something else is different about him.
When I was finished speaking, he paused, taking a moment to think, "Astrid, have you ever had any unusual dreams?"
Oh dear lord, yes! The answer is obvious before I even get to ask the question. But I bite my tongue, because I feel bad lying to the doctor, especially when I am trying to help him. I nod my head, "Yes, I often dream about flying. I'm not sure if that means much though, I guess I'm not sure if I should tell you about them. They aren't very interesting, I'm afraid."
Dr. Szozas smiles, "That is alright; I won't be offended if you keep those private. So, I'm guessing that you are aware that there are people out there who are able to fly. You are also probably aware that most people are not born with that ability. There are many ways that one can learn to control their body, but the best way is to receive a gift from the gods."
I'm

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Alice."
He nods, and then leans forward, elbows resting on his knees, hands clasped together, "And why are you here?"
That question brings a blush to my cheeks. It feels odd to admit this aloud, but I feel embarrassed talking about myself. But he asks, and I answer, "Well... I think there might be something wrong with me. I have been feeling off lately, and I don't know what's happening..."
He nods again, and smiles softly, "Do you mind if we start by discussing your symptoms? If you'd prefer not to discuss them, please tell us now, and we can move along."
Oh god, I thought. This guy sounds pretty good, but I guess I should just go ahead and say whatever pops into my head, right? I nod, and begin, "Yes, I do mind if you discuss my symptoms." I pause, thinking back on all the times I've felt weird or different since starting college: The time when I woke up naked after a dreamless sleep; the time when I couldn't get out of bed because my body had frozen; the time when my breasts were suddenly super sensitive and painful; the time when I went through the entire school day without having to pee; the time I got drunk and ended up throwing up; the time I was walking home alone at night and I heard footsteps behind me; the time I found a dead mouse in the library; the time I was so tired that I fell asleep in class; the time I saw a girl that I liked and I was afraid to talk to her; the time I accidentally walked into the girls bathroom; the time I took a shower and I was surprised to find that I was wet; the time I was sitting at the table and I realized that I was drooling; the time I was at the grocery store and I spilled a whole gallon of milk; the time I was at the gym and I found

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is...Alicia."
He nods, "And why did you choose this particular therapist?"
I pause again, and then answer, "Well, um..." My mind goes blank. What can I say? I have no idea what makes sense or doesn't. But then I decide to tell him the truth, "It seemed like the most logical choice."
There is a momentary silence before he responds, "That's very good thinking, Alicia. It would seem that we are both rational people, capable of making decisions based on logic rather than emotionality or superstition. That's a wonderful trait to share with one another." He pauses, perhaps waiting for me to add something, but I remain silent. "Do you know anything about psychology or psychiatry?"
Again I hesitate, not sure if I should disclose any personal information, but after several moments, I finally reply, "No sir."
Dr. Szozas smiles at me, "You may call me Michael." His smile turns into a wide grin, and he continues, "Excellent! Let's start with a little history: How old are you now?"
I think back to the last birthday I had celebrated. I was twenty-nine years old, which means that I'm thirty right now. I guess I'm just a few days shy of being a 'young adult', I think to myself. I also realize that I don't really know when I turned eighteen. I'm fairly certain that I'm legally an adult, but I'm pretty sure that I'm still a minor. I feel a bit embarrassed to admit that I am a mere teenager, but I'm too afraid to lie about it, so I simply nod.
Michael looks at his watch, and says, "OK, let's try to get a better picture of where you are in life, and I'll ask some questions to help us do that."
I'm a bit nervous, but I find that I

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Astrid Leander, and I've been feeling... off."
He nods thoughtfully, and then asks, "How long have you felt this way?"
"A while now..."
"And what do you think is wrong with you?"
"I don't know exactly, but I can tell something isn't right."
"Can you give me any examples? Describe your symptoms to me."
So I describe my episodes, how they feel, the sensations, the emotions, the thoughts, and the memories that seem to come unbidden. He listens intently, nodding along. When I finish, he leans back in his chair, hands clasped together on his lap, elbows resting against the arms of the chair, and looks at me thoughtfully.
After several minutes of silence, he finally speaks up, "It sounds like there are multiple components to your condition. How would you categorize them?"
I consider the question, and I answer, "Well, the most common one is memory loss. But when that happens, other things happen too: feelings of anxiety, panic attacks, confusion, and sometimes anger. There are also times where I just get lost. And, uhm, I'm not sure if I should call it a 'side effect' or not, but I'm having trouble sleeping lately."
Dr. Szozas sits forward and places his fingertips to his lips, thinking carefully. He continues to look at me for a few moments before speaking again, "Let's start with the first symptom that I mentioned: the memory problems. Tell me more about that."
So I go through the same description that I did with the others, but Dr. Szozas stops me halfway through the description of the episode with the bar fight. He gestures with his hand, "Could you stop there a moment please?"
"Why?" I ask, confused by his request.
Dr. Szozas stands up

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Rebecca Taylor."
He smiles again, nods encouragingly, and asks, "Rebecca, tell me what brings you here today?"
So I begin: "Well...it all started yesterday morning..."
* * *
It had been two weeks since I'd seen Dr. Szozas, and I was back in his office once more. This time, however, there were other people present besides myself and Dr. Szozas. There was another woman, who sat across the room from us, her legs crossed under herself, arms folded in front of her chest, wearing a white lab coat, she appeared to be in charge. She was very attractive, with long dark hair and bright green eyes. Her face was quite striking, yet not overly pretty; just beautiful.
There was also another man seated next to this woman, whom I would later learn was named Dr. Michael Szozas (the same person). He was dressed casually, in a blue shirt and tan pants, and wore no shoes or socks, and his feet rested comfortably atop a pile of books, which I assumed to be his own personal library. The doctor seemed to be listening attentively to our conversation, but occasionally looked up at me with a curious expression. I couldn't help but smile at the sight of them both, they made such a nice couple.
Dr. Szozas asked me to start by telling the group what brought me to his office today. I began to describe the events that transpired during the past week, beginning with the night I received the invitation to visit the web. I described the sensation of being pulled into the virtual world, the feeling of falling, and the subsequent disorientation and dizziness I felt when I woke up the following day.
Dr. Szozas nodded his head at me periodically, and when I finished speaking, the woman sitting next to him spoke up, "Thank you, Ms. Taylor, that's enough for now

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Célestine, and...well..."
He cuts me off by leaning forward and saying, "It's all right, just start talking."
So I do, telling him everything that happened since the incident last night: the dreams, the feeling of being watched, the strange sense of déjà vu, the strange noises that kept waking me up, even though they were only the wind outside the window. And then I tell him about the web, which he tells me is called the internet. I also mention that there have been more instances of this strange behavior, and now that I think back on it, I realize that I've had similar feelings before. It makes me wonder if maybe I'm becoming unhinged.
Dr. Szozas listens patiently, nodding along with my words. When I finish, he sits quietly, thinking, taking notes. Finally he looks up, "Tell me about your family history."
Well, I don't know much about my family history because my parents died when I was young. My grandmother raised me after that, but she passed away not too long ago. I suppose I should talk about her. She was an amazing woman; strong willed and determined. I remember once we went camping with our families, and I woke up one morning to find that she'd built a fire, cooked breakfast, packed up camp, and gone exploring. I didn't see her until dinner time. I asked where she'd been, and she said that she wanted to get a better view of the stars.
She wasn't a scientist or anything; she worked at a bank, but I guess that's what made her interesting to me; she would read about scientific discoveries, and write about them in journals that I found while cleaning out the garage. I always wondered about the things that I read about, the theories and ideas that I never really understood.
And I remembered something else about Grandma; I heard a

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is ... uh ..."
He interrupts me, saying, "You don't have to tell me your real name."
I think back to what I've been reading online, and I say, "Well, I know this sounds strange, but I go by 'Lily.'"
"That's fine, Lily. It's just us here, now," he reassures me.
As we begin our conversation, I feel myself relax. We talk about my problems, and how they started. As I open up to him, I realize that he doesn't judge me; instead he listens attentively, patiently waiting for me to finish before asking any questions. He asks me if there is anything else I want to discuss, and I mention that I had trouble sleeping last night because I kept thinking about all the things I'd done wrong recently, and I couldn't stop worrying about them.
Dr. Szozas nods thoughtfully, then responds, "Yes, I can relate to that; I get those kinds of thoughts too."
We talk about what I do when I worry, which leads to an interesting discussion about anxiety disorders, depression, and the role that stress plays in both mental health and physical wellness.
After a while I ask, "So, is the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder a possibility?"
He looks at me with a puzzled expression, but he replies, "No, I don't believe so; I haven't heard that term used much lately, but I'm not familiar with the symptoms you describe."
"But I was a soldier, and I was in a war zone; I saw people die, and I was shot at, and I was scared all the time, and I felt horrible about the whole thing. I was doing the best I could to help the other soldiers, but I didn't really understand that I was suffering from PTSD until I read about it on the web. I read about the flashbacks, and the

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Kelly Harker." My heart beats faster as I continue, "And... um..."
He smiles again, and nods encouragingly, "Go ahead, tell me why you've sought help."
So I do: "Well, I have this problem where I can hear people talking, even though they aren't saying anything. It started after I had surgery last year. Apparently the surgeon left something inside me, because now I can just barely pick up sounds coming from nearby rooms, and sometimes I'll get snippets of conversations. The doctors say there's nothing wrong with me physically, and that it's psychological, but I don't know if I believe them or not."
Dr. Szozas sits quietly, listening intently to my story. When I finish speaking, he responds, "It certainly does sound like an auditory hallucination. Have you tried taking medication?"
"Yes, I took several different drugs. Nothing worked."
"How did the medications work? Did any of them seem to improve the condition?"
"No. They made things worse. Sometimes I would feel dizzy, nauseous, and drowsy, but that was only temporary relief. If I stayed on the pills long enough, I'd eventually go back to being normal. I stopped using the meds three months ago. I'm hoping that maybe I can stop the hallucinations by myself."
"Hm, I'm sorry to hear that. That is a very unfortunate side effect of the medications that are commonly prescribed to treat PTSD. What about other symptoms? Do you suffer from insomnia, nightmares, flashbacks, and/or panic attacks?"
"Oh, yes! I often wake up screaming. I also tend to avoid social situations, and I'm afraid I'm going to hurt somebody accidentally. I'm having trouble sleeping at night, and I'm feeling really depressed and anxious all the time. I think I might be suffering from depression, but I haven't been

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Jenna Marie."
He nods knowingly, then he turns back to face me, and asks again, "Why did you contact me?"
"Well, um..." I pause, searching for the right words. I don't want to give away too much information, especially since this guy knows nothing about me. What would a therapist do? How does one go about finding a good therapist? The more I think about it, the more I realize that I can't just tell the truth. But I feel safe talking to Dr. Szozas, and I have faith in his ability to help me...
So I begin by telling him that I've been having trouble sleeping lately, and that I wake up several times during the night. I explain that I often find myself thinking about things that happen to me, and I try to shake those thoughts off, but they keep coming back, invading my dreams. And I'm not sure if I should call them nightmares or visions, because sometimes it feels like I'm seeing what actually happened to me, and other times I'm experiencing something completely different. Sometimes I hear voices, and even though I know that there are no people present, I still believe that the voice belongs to somebody else. I also describe how I'm feeling emotionally unstable, and that I have trouble focusing when I'm awake. I mention that I've been eating less than usual, and that I haven't been exercising at all. I feel that I am losing weight, but I don't understand why.
Dr. Szozas listens intently to everything that I say, nodding his head and smiling at me throughout the interview. He keeps asking me questions about my childhood, about the family that I grew up with, about my friends. I talk about my high school years, about the small town that I lived in, about the time that I spent with my boyfriend when I was younger, about the times that I had to deal with the death of my

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Evelyn Konev." I pause again, thinking of something else to say.
He nods slowly, waiting patiently, "And why have you decided to seek treatment?"
I shrug, and then think better of it, "It's hard to explain...it feels like there's something wrong with me..." I feel like I'm losing control of this conversation somehow. My mind wanders off, trying to figure out what I should do next.
Dr. Szozas smiles knowingly at me, "You don't know what's happening to you? You can't explain it?"
I shake my head slightly, "No, I just...don't know."
"Well, let me start by asking a few questions: Are you taking any medications or supplements? Do you smoke cigarettes?" He asks.
Smoking would be bad, yes I suppose. I've tried to quit several times before, but I always end up smoking a cigarette after quitting. It makes me crave them, which is weird because they taste awful.
"Do you drink alcohol?"
I shake my head no. "Not much anymore," I reply, feeling a little guilty about that one. Alcohol is not good for you either.
Dr. Szozas gives me a knowing smile, "So I guess we need to get to the bottom line. Why are you here today?"
There is a long silence between us. I stare at the floor, avoiding his gaze.
Dr. Szozas is patient, "Evelyn, please look at me when you speak to me. Tell me if anything is troubling you, okay?"
I nod, "Okay."
He stares at me intently, his face showing no emotion whatsoever. His voice is low and calm, "What is it that is bothering you?"
I look at him, and I begin to tell him about my feelings, but I stop myself at the last moment. I'm
