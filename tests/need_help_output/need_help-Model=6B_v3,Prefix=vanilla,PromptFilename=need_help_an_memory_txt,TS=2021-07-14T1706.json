He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no.

Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",

I've been seeing this guy named Alex for a few months now...\"\n\"Alex? What does Alex have to do with anything?\"\nI pause, unsure where to go with this story. It feels very intimate, and personal, but I know that Dr. Szozas will respect my privacy if I tell him all about my life before meeting Alex. I decide to start at the beginning.   I explain that I met my husband, Alex, while we were both students at Stanford University. We hit it off right away, and soon after graduation, I moved into his apartment downtown. He was working for one of those big tech companies, doing something related to data security or cryptography, I can't remember exactly what. I worked as an accountant, and I didn't really care what I did, I just wanted to live in San Francisco and enjoy being a young, single woman living alone. I loved my job, and I had a lot of friends, I'd even dated an engineer back home, and I enjoyed spending time with them. I knew I was good at my work, and I felt confident in my ability to succeed in my career. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life, I thought maybe I should try to get into law school. I liked my job, I liked the people I worked with, and I really enjoyed my social activities. I guess I didn't think much about my future. I never expected to meet anyone, let alone fall in love with a man I met online. I hadn't given any serious consideration to dating, because I assumed I'd be too busy with my career, my studies, my hobbies, etc.\nI continue, \"Anyway, I met Alex through a mutual friend, and I went out with him a couple",

  "prompt": "I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",
  "result": "My name is Jane Doe, and I've been seeing a therapist named Dr. Michael Szozas.\"  There is a pause after I say this, as though waiting for something more. I don't know what else to add. My heart beats rapidly. I can feel myself getting hot under the collar, but I try not to let my emotions show too much.\nDr. Szozas nods, \"Why have you been seeing Dr. Szozas?\"   I open my mouth to speak, then close it again, and I consider carefully before answering, \"It's difficult to explain... I guess there isn't really one reason...\" I think back to all those years ago when my father left us, leaving only two people to deal with our problems. I remember my mother being angry and upset, and she would blame herself for not doing enough, or saying the wrong things to her husband. She cried, sometimes silently, other times screaming at the top of her lungs. I was confused by my parents fighting, and I was scared that they were going to get divorced, I was afraid to ask questions, I just wanted them to stop crying. It was awful. I felt helpless. I was always trying to help, and I tried to do what I thought was right, even if I didn't understand what was happening. I was such a child, and I was so young. I was still a little girl, and I was terrified that I was going to lose my family forever. I was a mess. I was a wreck. I had no idea where I stood with my dad, I wasn't sure if I loved him anymore. I didn't know who I was, I couldn't decide whether I was happy with my mom. I was lost, I needed guidance. I was desperate. I was hurting. I was lonely. I was hurt.\nI took refuge in my imagination, and I created a world that made sense to me; a place",
