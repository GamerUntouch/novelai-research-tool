=== Prompt ========================================
I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.

[Year: 2020 AD]
[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "


=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Zander."
He smiles at me again, nodding, then looks back to his computer monitor, typing something in. It doesn't appear to be a web page; perhaps he's writing notes?
"So, Alexandra...you say you have been experiencing certain issues?"
"Yes, sir. Well, I don't know if they qualify as 'issues', exactly..."
"Alexandra, please just call me Michael. And yes, I believe that they do indeed qualify as an issue, but let's start at the beginning. Why don't we begin by asking what brought you here today?"
"Well, I was feeling really stressed out about schoolwork. My grades weren't great, and I felt bad because my parents were paying for all this stuff to help me study, and I wasn't using any of the resources available to me. But there seemed to be no way forward, and I didn't feel like I had anyone to talk to about my situation."
Michael nods at me, and I continue, "And I started getting paranoid, and I couldn't sleep at night; I'd lie awake thinking, and worrying, and I found myself starting to think that maybe I should drop out of college. 
But I knew I wanted to go, I loved the idea of being a doctor someday, I liked the idea of helping people. I decided to keep going, and I tried to get a better handle on my situation, and I thought that seeing a counselor would probably be a good thing."
I pause to collect my thoughts, "I guess my biggest problem is that I've never been in a relationship before. I'm not sure if I can trust a guy; I've always sort of figured that I'll meet a nice boy, and fall in love with him. But when I actually try to date, it feels like everything is wrong. 
I find myself attracted to the same type of guys; tall dark and

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Zabrisko."
He nods, and looks at his notes, then back at me, "Alexandra, I'd like to start by asking you questions about yourself, where you live, what your job is...?"
I answer each question carefully, because I feel compelled to tell him everything. But there are parts of my life that I don't want to share yet, and I try not to let those slip through the cracks. I've never been good at keeping secrets, but this time I think it will be alright.
We chat for a while, and I can sense that he is really listening to my answers, which makes me relax more and more. 
Then we move onto other topics, such as hobbies, favorite foods, and places I have visited. He asks if I play any sports, and I admit I do. He smiles, "I hope I'll get a chance to watch you on the field sometime soon!"
I blush, and smile, "That would be awesome!"
He continues, "You seem to be having a lot of problems lately. You said you were seeing a counselor? What exactly is the problem you're dealing with?"
I sigh, "I just need help, I guess."
Dr. Szozas sits up, "What kind of help specifically?"
I shrug, "I don't know. I'm not sure. I keep feeling like something is wrong, and I'm not sure what. I'm scared, I'm angry, I'm confused..."
Dr. Szozas listens intently, and I wonder if I'm being too vague. I'm trying to explain myself, and I feel like I'm making things worse.
But Dr. Szozas is nodding along, and when I finish, he stands up, "I'm going to write up a referral for a psychiatrist, I'm sure they can help you. I'm sorry I couldn't offer

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Zabrisky."
He nods, "And tell us about yourself."
I pause again, and then I continue, "Well, um... I have this friend named Nickolai Dittrich, who I met while we were both attending Harvard University. We became friends because we had similar interests and passions, but our personalities clashed somewhat. And eventually, things came to a head between us, and I broke off all contact with him. But recently, I found myself thinking about him, and I decided that I wanted to try and get back together with him, despite the fact that we've been apart for several years now. That is the reason I'm here today, although there are other reasons too..."
Dr. Szozas raises an eyebrow and looks at me quizzically, "Other reasons?"
I nod, "Yes. I think I'm having trouble dealing with the idea of being alone. I don't know if I can handle the loneliness, the isolation, the lack of human interaction.   I also feel very guilty for what happened to Nickolai, for what I did to him. I feel responsible for his death. I want to apologize, and to say that I'm sorry. But I just can't bring myself to do it. I'd rather die than face him and admit my guilt."
"Alexandra, I understand what you're saying. I really do. I would not be surprised if you felt the way you do. I'm sure you're feeling a great deal of remorse and shame for the actions you took against Nickolai. I imagine you believe that you caused his death, and I'm willing to bet that the only person in the universe who believes differently is you. You may even blame yourself for the entire incident. I'm not trying to put words into your mouth, I'm merely telling you how I personally interpret your feelings.
"I agree with you, I think that you

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Karpinski."   I pause, and then continue, "and I came because I think I might have been cursed by one of those creepy wizards..."
He smiles again, "Yes, we can discuss this further later. Tell me about the curse, please?"   He leans forward slightly in his chair, his eyes fixed intently upon mine.
I tell him the story, and his expression remains unchanged throughout, except for the occasional smile or chuckle when I describe something amusing. When I finish talking, he looks at me for a moment before speaking, "I believe you've had an encounter with a dark wizard that is causing you emotional distress. It sounds like there may also be physical manifestations as well, but I would need more information for that part of the diagnosis to proceed. Do you want to talk a little bit more about what happened? How did you feel after the incident, and what was the outcome?"
I nod my head, and I say, "yes", to the question.
Dr. Szozas asks, "What were you wearing when the event occurred, what was the weather like where you live, and what time was the incident?"
I answer, "I was home alone, and I was just walking through the front yard when I saw a flash of light and heard a sound, and when I looked up I saw a black shadow falling out of the sky. The next thing I knew I was standing in the middle of the street, and the sun wasn't shining, and the air smelled really bad. I tried to go back inside, but I couldn't. I was stuck on the sidewalk for a while, until a police car arrived and the officers helped me up. I went to the hospital, and they gave me a few shots and put me on some medicine, and I felt better for a couple days, but then I started getting sick, and now I'm not feeling too good. I haven

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Harris." And then I continue, "and... um..." I don't know what else to say. I feel awkward, flustered, uncertain.
He smiles again, "Alexandra, please tell me about what brought you to this point."
And so I do. My story begins when I was just eight years old, but I can go back further than that if necessary. It all started when I met the boy next door. He lived across the street from us, and we were both playing outside our respective homes one day. We had been friends since birth; I was always drawn to his smile, and his infectious laugh. But things changed after I turned eleven, when I became interested in boys. 
It wasn't long before I found myself becoming infatuated with the idea of dating a guy. I thought that if I dated a cute guy, maybe I would get a boyfriend, or even a husband. I wanted to date a good-looking guy, because I knew that I was a pretty girl. I didn't want anyone to think I was ugly or anything, I just wanted a nice, handsome, sweet, caring, loving, and attentive partner. I decided that I needed a very special person, and I wanted to find that special person through a romantic relationship.
I went on a few dates with a couple guys, and they weren't too bad, but I never felt any real connection to them. I asked my parents for advice, and I told them that I wanted to meet a nice, smart, and nice-to-me young man, and I asked if I could start going on a few dates. They agreed, and I did my best to be a good girlfriend.
I made sure that I wore nice clothes and makeup on my dates. I also learned how to dress in a way that attracted the attention of men. I got plenty of compliments on my looks; some people said that I looked like

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Zoltan." I pause for effect, then add, "And I don't know what else to say. I've been feeling weird lately...like there's something wrong with me, but I can't put my finger on what it is..."
He nods, and smiles again, "That's good enough for now. Tell me more about this 'weirdness,' if you will."
I begin telling him all the things that have happened since I got home last night. I tell him about the strange dreams, the sudden urge to get away, and that I had to leave school early today.
Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding along as I talk; his smile never wavers throughout the entire conversation. When I finish talking, he asks a few questions, and I answer them honestly, trying not to let my mind wander off topic.
Then he looks at me, and tells me to close my eyes. I do, and I feel his hands gently caressing my face, and his thumbs rubbing my temples. He speaks softly, "Alexandra, I want you to relax, and think back on the events leading up to the day before yesterday. Think back on the week prior to when you arrived in our fair city. What did you eat? Did anything unusual happen?"
I try to remember, "I ate a lot of pizza, a couple of meals at the diner, and I went to the movies on Friday. I didn't really drink much, or smoke, and nothing unusual happened. I was pretty bored, actually, I hadn't done a whole lot in a while. I was just thinking I wanted to go out, maybe catch a movie, and hang out at the mall for a little bit. I guess I felt like I needed to shake up my routine, or something. I was hoping for a fun, exciting adventure, instead of staying cooped up in my room. I thought I'd give

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Zabriskie, and I have a problem."
He smiles again, and nods, "Go ahead, please continue."
So I do. I explain the whole story about the incident last week, and then I ask, "What can you tell me?"
Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair, crossing his legs, and taking off his glasses, setting them aside.   He leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees, hands clasped together. He stares at me for a moment before speaking, "Well, let's start by getting to know each other better, shall we? I'm Michael, and I'd like to get to know you a little more intimately."
Now this is strange; normally people don't want to get to know you more intimately, they just want to fuck you. But I say, "Sure!"
Michael smiles, and asks, "Are you ready for our next session?"
I nod.
Dr. Szozas stands up, and reaches into his pocket for a pen, and a notepad, and a calculator, and a phone, and a laptop, and a stack of papers.
I stand up, and follow after him, and I ask, "What are you doing all that for?"
Dr. Szozas turns, and looks at me, "Alexandra, I've been thinking, and I think I understand what the issue is with you, and I believe I can help. Let me try and figure out the best way to approach things. I'll need to use a few tools, and I'm going to have to ask you a lot of questions to help me determine the right course of action. Are you alright with that?"
I am surprised, but I reply, "Yes, I guess..."
Dr. Szozas leads me to the door, and opens it for me. I step out into the hallway, and he closes the

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Zabrisko."
He looks back at his notes, and then to me again, "And why have you chosen to visit me?"
I think about this question carefully before answering, "Well, because I don't know what else to do. I've tried talking to my parents, but they won't listen. I even went to talk to my sister, but she just laughed at me. She said that I was being silly, and I should stop wasting her time. But now I need help, and maybe you can give me advice or something."
Dr. Szozas smiles kindly at me, "That sounds very much like an issue with communication, Ms. Zabrisko. I'd say we start there, and work our way backwards to the root cause.  Would you agree?   Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?"
I smile at him, "Not at all."
"How old are you, Alexandra?"
I pause, and consider the answer, "I'll be sixteen next month."
"Are you currently enrolled in school?"
I nod, "Yes."
"What grade level are you in?"
I shrug, "I guess I'm in the eleventh grade, I haven't taken the test yet, but I'm planning on taking the SATs soon."
"Have you ever been in therapy, or counseling before?"
"No," I admit, "I've never had any issues that needed to be addressed until recently."
"So you came here for the first time to address a problem, correct?"
I sigh, "Yeah, I guess I did. I was really depressed after my father died last year. I didn't want to go to college, and I wanted to end my life. I felt worthless and stupid and ugly...and I thought I would rather die than live without my dad. I wouldn't eat, sleep, or

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Zabrisk."
He smiles, "Alexandra, that's lovely. And why have you come?"
"Well, uh..."   It's hard to put into words exactly what I want to say, but I feel like I should tell him something about myself. "You know, there are certain things that... just aren't right for me."
He nods, "And do you think they'll ever get better? Do you think you can find a way to resolve them?"
I sigh, "No. They won't go away. It's always been this way."
He nods again, and then asks, "So, what would you call those issues?"
I shake my head, "Uh... I don't really know. I've never felt this way before. I guess I'd call it a lack of confidence, or maybe I need help dealing with my insecurities. I don't even understand what's happening to me, I don't know if I'm depressed or if I need medication or if I'm bipolar or if I need therapy or if I need a lobotomy or if I need a sex change or if I need to kill myself or if I need a therapist or if I need a psychiatrist or if I need to talk to a psychiatrist or if I need a counselor or if I need to talk to a counselor or if I need to see a psychologist or if I need to see a psychotherapist or if I need to see a psychiatrist, a counselor, a therapist, a mental health professional, a medical doctor, a physician, a healer, a shaman, a witch, a wizard, a warlock, a sorcerer, a mage, a magician, a druid, a cleric, a priest, a paladin, a bard, an artist, a musician, a writer, a poet, a philosopher, a saint, a sinner, a criminal, a victim, a survivor, a

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Alexandra Zarek."   I pause, thinking about what else I should say.
He smiles back at me, "Go ahead Alex, tell me what's been bothering you?"
I feel embarrassed, because I've never really talked to anyone about this before, but I can't stop now.   "I think I might have gone mad..."
"Mad? Why do you say that?"
"Well...it started a few months ago, when I was playing online chess. I had just won a game against a guy called 'Hannibal', and then I lost the next one to 'Ricardo'. I couldn't figure out why, and then after losing again to Ricardo, I got an idea. Maybe there was something wrong with the program, or maybe the computer wasn't working right. So I asked Hannibal if he would play another match with me on the same machine, and he agreed.
And I thought, well, if I win the third time, I'll know for sure. And I did. But when I went home, I realized I'd forgotten the password on my account, and I tried to log on, and I couldn't remember the password, and I kept trying, and I couldn't get in. I knew I needed the password, and I didn't. I spent hours on the internet, and I looked for the answer, I read all the articles, I searched everywhere, but I couldn't find the answer.
So the next day I logged on again, and I played a couple games, and I was winning and I was having fun, and I noticed I was getting better at the game. I thought I was doing well, and I felt great, and I thought that if I keep going, I will beat the other two players, and I will be a real master player of the game. So I played a lot, and I practiced and I studied, and I learned more and
