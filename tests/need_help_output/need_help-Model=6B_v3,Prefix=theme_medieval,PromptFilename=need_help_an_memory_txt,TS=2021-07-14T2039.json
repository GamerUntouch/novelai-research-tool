He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",

A serious one...\"\nHe looks at me curiously, and asks, \"Tell me about it.\"\nAnd then I do. I tell him all about my problems, and the things that are bothering me. He listens intently until I finish. When I'm done, he sits there silently for a few moments. I watch his face carefully for any signs of disapproval, or judgment, or disgust. I wait patiently for him to speak.\nFinally, I get an answer. \"I'll admit, I find this very unusual. You say that you've been having trouble sleeping? That the dreams seem to be getting worse, more vivid, and disturbing?\"\nI nod. \"Yes, sir, I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong, or if I'm just not getting enough rest.

  "prompt": "I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",
  "result": "My name is Kayla Anderson.\" I pause, and then continue, \"And, um... I don't know why I'm here?\" I ask, hoping to get this conversation started.\nHe responds, \"You tell me, Miss Anderson.\"\nI close my mouth, and let my mind wander back to our brief email exchange. It felt odd that he would use my middle name, but maybe I should have used my last name instead? That was silly, though. \nAs I think about the situation, I begin to feel uneasy. Why did I just decide to tell him my whole life story? Maybe I shouldn't have said anything at all. I can always say something later if he wants to talk more.\nDr. Szozas looks up at the ceiling, and sighs softly before asking, \"How long do we usually spend together, before I start asking questions?\"\nI blurt out, \"Oh, I guess I didn't really give much thought to that. I figured I'd only need a few minutes, since I already sent an email to you. I suppose I'll need a couple hours at least!\"\nI blush a little, and I realize I've been too forward, \"I'm sorry, I didn't really mean to be rude. I'm new to counseling myself, and I haven't had many experiences with the process. I hope I wasn't being too pushy, or arrogant. I'm not sure what to expect, and I was a bit nervous to meet you. I'm still a bit nervous, and I apologize for my outburst. I'm trying to be honest and open, and I'm really interested in learning from you. I was thinking that I could probably leave after an hour, or two at the most. I'm not sure when my next appointment is, and I wanted to come early. I'm a bit anxious because I'm not sure how I will react to the session, and I want to",
