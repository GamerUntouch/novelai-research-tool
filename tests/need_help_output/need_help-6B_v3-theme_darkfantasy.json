  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Jane Doe.\"\nHe nods slowly, his gaze still locked onto mine. \"And why have you decided to visit me today?\"\nI pause again, then say, \"Well, because... I don't know...\" My mind races, trying to figure out what this strange feeling inside me is all about. It feels like there's something wrong with me, but I can't put my finger on what exactly it is. I try to think back to times before now where I felt the same way. But nothing springs to mind. And I feel like if I didn't do something soon, I would explode. Like something terrible was waiting just outside the door, ready to pounce and kill me at any moment. I fear that I've been caught up in something much bigger than myself, and I'm afraid to find out what it is. \"Because I'm not sure what else to do,\" I admit. \"This isn't normal.\"\nDr. Szozas looks thoughtful, pondering a question, or perhaps thinking about a diagnosis. His eyebrows furrow slightly, which only makes him seem more handsome somehow. He looks up at me, his eyes intent and serious, \"What aren't you sure about? What is making you nervous about coming to see me?\"\nI shrug, \"Everything, I guess. The whole situation. I don't even know if I'm doing the right thing. I want to trust people, but I'm scared to death to trust anyone with this problem. I'm worried that I'm going to get hurt if I open up to others. I'm not sure I'm qualified to be a therapist, but I'm also terrified that I'm the one that needs help, but I'm too proud to ask for it. I'm confused. I'm angry. I'm sad. I'm lonely. I'm anxious. I'm lost. I'm frustrated. I'm depressed. I'm terrified. I'm desperate to be",
