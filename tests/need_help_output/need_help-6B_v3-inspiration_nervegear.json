It's not surprising that you've lost interest in socializing with other people, nor is it surprising that you don't find video gaming enjoyable.

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded.

Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded.

So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him.

Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

It wasn't just a normal feeling of sleepiness, but something else, almost like an itch or pressure deep inside my chest. I couldn't move, and I was afraid to open my eyes.\"\n\"Hmm...that sounds quite interesting indeed. What did you do next? Did you wake up?\"\n\"Yes. But not right away. Instead, there was a noise outside the window, like footsteps. The door opened, and two men entered the room. They were dressed completely in black suits, and they carried guns. I tried to get up to run, but I was paralyzed. And when one of them turned his gun toward me, I woke up screaming.\"\nDr. Szozas sits silently for a moment, processing the information. When I don't say anything, he asks, \"Did you feel any fear during the dream itself, or only afterwards?\"\n\"Only after I woke up.\"\n\"Interesting. That is very common among people who have been through traumatic experiences such as rape, kidnapping, assault, etcetera. After the trauma occurs, the brain often blocks out the memory of the event until a later time. In the case of a nightmare, the experience is usually triggered by a subconscious link to the original incident. For example, if a person is raped, the rapist might appear in a dream, which is then linked to the actual perpetrator. This is called the 'flashback effect.'\"\n\"Oh...\"",
