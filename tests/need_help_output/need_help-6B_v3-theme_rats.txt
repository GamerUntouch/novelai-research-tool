=== Prompt ========================================
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "

=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Violette."
He nods, "Violette? Very good, now tell me why you're here?"
Oh boy...here goes nothing, I think to myself, and I proceed to spill my guts, telling him all about my recent past: meeting John, finding out about their plan, leaving the country club, coming back home, being attacked by the rats, losing my memory, waking up in this room. As I speak, I feel more relaxed than I have ever felt before. It feels natural to talk to him, and I realize I trust him completely. When I finish speaking, he sits silently staring off into space for several minutes, then looks back at me and asks, "So what do you want from me?"
That question really throws me off guard, because I had expected something different. I stammer out an answer, "Well, I don't know..."
Dr. Szozas smiles gently, "You don't know?"
I shake my head, "No, I guess not."
He stands up, "OK, let's go get some coffee, we can discuss this while we walk."
We leave the office, walking side-by-side through the hallway, and I'm surprised to hear the sound of laughter echoing throughout the building. We stop outside a small break room that is decorated with posters showing smiling people having fun at a park, a restaurant, a beach, etc.
"What is that noise?" I ask.
"Ah, yes, that would be the 'laughing therapy' group that meets here every Tuesday evening," Dr. Szozas explains.
"Laughing therapy!" I exclaim.
"Yes, they meet here at 6pm, every week, and they laugh together until 7pm," he continues.
"Do they always come to the same time, the same place, every week?" I inquire.
"Always, every week," he

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Mary Jane Watson."
He nods, and then asks, "How old are you?"
I answer, "Twenty one years old."
"And where do you live now?"
"New York City."
"Are you married? Do you have children?"
"No, I don't have any kids yet."
"Do you work?"
"Yes, I'm working at Marvel Comics right now."
"Marvel... comic book company..."
"Yeah, they hired me just recently."
"So what brings you to me today?"
"Well, after reading all about you online, I decided that I should talk to you."
"You've been reading about me?" He smiles, and leans back into his chair, "What did you find out?"
"That you were born in New Jersey, raised in Florida, went to Harvard Medical School, worked at NYU medical school for awhile, and moved to Los Angeles to become a psychiatrist."
"Hmm, interesting. What else can you tell me about me?"
"Your favorite color is blue, you enjoy good food and wine, and you play chess regularly with a friend named Peter Parker."
"Wow!" His smile widens into a grin, "Peter Parker... I'm surprised to hear that I'm friends with Spider-Man, but I guess I am. Is there anything more about me that you know about me that I haven't told you?"
"Well, I know that you have a girlfriend named Gwen Stacey, that you used to be a superhero called Captain America, that you were a member of the Avengers team, that you lost a leg to an experimental drug, that you had a son, that you dated a woman named Peggy Carter, that you saved the world a couple times, that you are a brilliant doctor, that you are a great chess player, and that you are a nice guy."
Dr. Szozas is grinning at

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Kate Baily." My heart races a little faster as I say this, because it feels important somehow. "And... um..." I pause again. This is hard. What do I want to tell him? The truth? Or something else? Should I just blurt it out, hoping it will all work itself out without me having to explain myself? No, I decide against it. It's too much pressure. Maybe later.
He nods encouragingly, "Go ahead, Ms. Baily, what can I help you with?"
"Well... I've been experiencing feelings of being different lately, and I don't know if they're related to my condition or not. But I think I may have some sort of mental disorder."
He smiles sympathetically, "You said 'different,' did you by any chance get hit in the head recently?"
Oh crap. That wasn't a good idea. He noticed the bump on my skull. "No, I didn't," I admit sheepishly.
"That would cause symptoms similar to yours. How long has it been since the injury occurred?"
"Um... three days ago." I answer honestly, then add hastily, "It was an accident. I fell off a ladder while fixing a leaky pipe."
Dr. Szozas' eyebrows raise slightly, but his expression doesn't change. I feel a surge of panic, and I ask, "Is there anything wrong with me?"
He laughs, a hearty laugh, "Not at all. You are perfectly normal, Miss Baily. In fact, I'd call you a very healthy young lady."
Relief floods through me, I relax a bit.
Dr. Szozas looks at me thoughtfully, "Have you ever had a strong desire to hurt others, to inflict pain on them, but were unable to carry out the act?"
A chill goes up my spine, I look at him, wide

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Billycan."
He nods, and then looks back up at me, "And why are you here?"
Well, this is awkward. I have never been asked questions by anyone before, let alone such important ones. What should I say? How can I explain all this to him? Should I tell him everything right now? No, that would probably scare him off... maybe later, after we've gotten to know each other better, I'll spill the beans, but not yet. Maybe there's something else I can offer him instead. I think for a moment, and decide to just start talking. "It started with a dream..."
* * *
Billycan:
You came to me because you had a dream, and you were concerned about what might happen if you didn't do anything about it. You are very fortunate indeed, Mr. Billycan, that I was available when you contacted me. My schedule is quite busy, but I will try to accommodate you as much as possible. As a matter of fact, you are exactly where you need to be.
First things first, please call me Michael. We are friends now, and I hope that you feel free to call me Mike too. I am a licensed psychiatrist, but I also hold an MBA degree, which allows me to practice both medicine and business simultaneously. I am not a specialist in dreams, but I am a professional, so I am well versed in many aspects of psychology and psychiatry. I understand that your dream was disturbing to you, but I am going to help you deal with it.
Your problem is that you are having a recurring nightmare that is driving you crazy. It is a fairly common symptom of stress or anxiety, but I am afraid that the cause is more complicated than that. I am sorry to disappoint you, but I cannot treat the source of the problem.
However, I am a doctor, and I am familiar with the symptoms. I am

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is..."
He cuts me off mid sentence, saying, "Yes?"
"...is... Mary Jane Watson."
"Mary Jane? That's lovely! What brings you here today?"
"Well, um, after reading the information on the web site, I decided to try this clinic. I've been having problems lately, and I think maybe they can help me figure things out."
"What kinds of problems have you had recently? Any recent stressors? Problems with friends or family? Anything specific?"
"Um, yes, actually. I've been feeling really strange lately. It started last week, and it just got worse. Everything feels different. My body doesn't feel right anymore, and I don't know what to do. I was thinking about coming in to talk to somebody about it."
Dr. Szozas looks at me intently for a moment before speaking again, "Can you tell me about any changes that you noticed within the past two weeks?"
"Oh, sure. Well, uhm, I was sleeping more than usual, and I didn't seem to get tired during the day. I also felt a little dizzy sometimes when walking up stairs or getting out of bed. I couldn't remember anything that happened the night before, which I never did before. I thought I might be losing my memory, but I wasn't worried about that because I knew that I would always be able to find something I needed if I looked hard enough. I even went through the motions to go to work one morning, but I woke up that afternoon with a terrible headache. I called into work to let them know that I wouldn't be there that day, but I forgot to call home and let my husband know that I'd be late. When I tried to call him later that evening, I realized that I hadn't spoken to him all day, and I wondered if he was still mad at me for being gone the previous weekend.

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Christina Rosecan."
He nods, and continues to watch me intently. It feels weird being watched this way by such a friendly face. I have never been observed before, only studied, dissected.  "Tell me, Ms. Rosecan, what do you think makes you tick?"
Oh God, did he just call me Ms.? That sounds so formal. "Well, I guess I'd say... I don't know really. I've always had trouble figuring myself out. My parents were both doctors, so they didn't understand me either. They thought I was lazy, stupid, or crazy, depending on which one of them I was talking to at the time. I can remember arguing with mom about getting straight A's, and then crying because she said I was trying too hard to please her. She used to tell me that I was 'too smart' to be happy. And dad would try to cheer me up with a joke about how I was probably destined to be a doctor or lawyer, not an engineer."
Dr. Szozas smiles at me, "And now? What do you think about yourself today?"
"Today I'm still struggling with things that happened yesterday, but I feel better about myself than I did last week. I want to get back into school, but I'm afraid I'll fail again if I go to classes with all the distractions there will be."
"Distractions?"
"Yeah, well, I got caught cheating in math class, and I failed the exam. I couldn't concentrate enough to study for the test; I kept thinking about the other kids at the table next to me laughing at me when I messed up the questions. I felt bad about failing, but I also knew that I shouldn't let it bother me. I mean, I cheated, after all! I know I should be able to handle it, but I keep feeling like I'm going to mess something else up.

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is John Henry Baxter III."
He nods slowly, and then asks, "And why did you come?"
I swallow hard, and say, "Well, I'm having trouble sleeping. It started last night, after reading about your work online. I've never been much good at sleep, but lately it just doesn't seem to want to let go of me. My mind keeps racing, thinking, worrying, and dreaming, all while I try to get rest. And then this morning, I had a nightmare... something terrible happened during the war..." I pause, and wait for his reaction.
"That sounds very similar to what we call 'sleep paralysis,' where one experiences vivid dreams, followed by waking up unable to move or speak. The brain cannot process the dream imagery properly, and thus becomes confused and frightened. Most people can usually remember their dreams, but they have difficulty describing them once awake. Some people experience nightmares so intense that they wake up screaming, others find themselves unable to breathe, paralyzed, unable to even open their mouths. Sleep paralysis is most often caused by a chemical imbalance within the body. There are several medications that will correct this condition, but I'll need to do an examination before prescribing anything. Do you understand? You may be suffering from sleep paralysis due to a lack of serotonin in your system. Can you describe the nature of the problem?"
This is the first time I've ever heard a doctor ask me such questions about myself. I'm amazed at his knowledge of the human anatomy. He knows a lot about the brain! I'm also impressed at the way that he thinks, the way that he analyzes the situation with a calm, collected, and logical approach. I feel a sense of relief that I don't have to lie anymore about my problems.
"Yes, yes I think I do. I'm not sure if I'm depressed, but I am experiencing a constant feeling that I am losing control of my life.

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Matthew." And then I pause. This is where things get weird. My mind spins wildly trying to figure out what to say next. It feels as though I have been thrown into this room by mistake. I feel like I should leave right now, before something bad happens. But instead I continue talking, "This isn't really happening, is it?" I ask myself.
Dr. Szozas smiles broadly at me, and nods. "It most certainly is, Matt. You've just had a very traumatic experience, one that is causing you great stress and anxiety. Your subconscious is working overtime to process all that happened, and it is doing its best to protect you. However, there is nothing wrong with your conscious mind. That part of you is functioning normally, telling you what is going on, and giving you the ability to think rationally about it. In fact, I'd venture to guess that it is taking a lot more effort than normal to keep up with the barrage of information coming at it."
He pauses, waiting for me to react, and when I don't, he continues, "So, let me tell you a little about myself. I am an associate professor at UCLA, specializing in clinical psychology. I work with individuals with unusual problems, such as yours, to help them cope with their issues. I also treat people with milder forms of trauma, helping to alleviate the symptoms they are experiencing. I am a licensed psychologist, but I do not prescribe drugs or other medications; I prefer to use therapy to help patients understand the root cause of their distress, and to find a solution that will allow them to move forward. I am a good listener, and I try to be empathetic to the needs and desires of each patient. I am a man who loves to hear stories about the past, but I am not a fan of rehashing old wounds. I am a man who enjoys reading, but I am no bookworm

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Lillian, and I don't know what to tell you."
He smiles, and nods his head gently, then asks, "Would you mind telling me what happened?"
So I begin by describing the strange things I've been experiencing, including seeing rats, and hearing voices, and being unable to control myself sexually.
When I finish talking, he sits quietly, rubbing his chin, thinking deeply. Finally, he looks up at me, and asks softly, "Do you have any history of mental illness? Family members or friends who might be able to corroborate this story?"
I shake my head 'no', feeling stupid.
"OK, let's start again: What were the circumstances under which you began having these symptoms?"
Again, I explain them, adding, "It started about a week ago, after I got back home from school. It was late afternoon, and I was just coming out of the shower, when suddenly all of the sudden...it felt like there was something inside me, trying to get out. And I couldn't stop it..."
Dr. Szozas raises an eyebrow at me, "And what did you do about it?"
"Nothing, I didn't want to think about it, I tried not to think about it."
"You tried not to think about it? That doesn't sound very healthy!" His tone is gentle, but firm.
"Well I wasn't happy about it either, but I had no choice. I can't fight it off, I feel compelled to obey the impulses I'm getting, I'm not sure if I should call it a compulsion, or a desire, I'm confused about the difference between the two. I'm afraid to resist, because I'm starting to hear voices, and I'm not making sense to anyone but me. I'm scared that I'm going to hurt someone, or damage property, I'm really worried about that. I just wish I

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Sharon Kaye."
He nods, and then looks back at me, waiting patiently for more information.
I pause again, feeling very uncomfortable, and then I continue, "Well... I think something may have happened to me recently..." My face feels hot, and I feel my throat constricting. "It might be hard to explain exactly what happened." I glance away from him, unable to meet those deep brown eyes any longer, and I begin to fidget nervously with one finger nail. I don't know where this is leading, but I can tell by the expression on his face that I should just get right to the point.
"Sharon, please, let me assure you that we will do our best to help you understand whatever problem or situation you are experiencing, okay?" He smiles reassuringly at me. "Tell me, does anything else seem off about yourself? Any other symptoms?"
I shake my head no, although I'm not sure if I really believe myself. It is difficult to put into words what's wrong with me; I've never been good at expressing emotions verbally. But I try anyway: "No, nothing that stands out to me."
"Okay, great! Why don't you start at the beginning, Sharon; describe the events that led up to your visit today. Tell me about the things that are bothering you, and I'll ask questions along the way to figure out what is going on with you." His voice is gentle and calming; I relax a little bit.
So I take a deep breath, and I begin to speak. I recount the entire day that I spent yesterday at the hospital. I talk about the strange dream I had, and the conversation I overheard between the doctor and the nurse. I tell him about the odd behavior I displayed, about the pain I felt, the fear. I go through the whole story, step-by-step. I stop talking when I reach the end,
