My name is Holo...Holo von Einem."
He smiles broadly again, "That's a lovely name! It reminds me of the famous German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Do you know Goethe?"
Well now this is interesting. I don't even have to think before responding, "Yes, quite well actually..." And then I pause. What should I say?
"Goethe said that 'Every person lives two times: once as himself, and a second time as part of the whole.'"
Dr. Szozas nods, "Indeed, indeed. You've lived twice already, haven't you?"
Oh gosh, what do I tell him next?! My heart races wildly, but I manage to continue, "And you are also a doctor?!"
"No, not exactly. I studied medicine, but I decided to pursue psychiatry instead. The world is changing too much, there was just too little understanding about mental illness back when I started out. But anyway, yes, I am a psychiatrist."
"But you are still a doctor!"
"Ahaha! Yes, I suppose I am. Though I believe that we doctors all go through a phase where we are fascinated by the unknown. We want to understand the human mind better than anyone else can."
Wow, I feel a chill run up my spine at that thought.
"So please, tell me about yourself. Tell me about your past experiences with the Church."
This is a strange question to ask a stranger, but I'm pretty sure that I'm being asked to talk about the things that I'm supposed to be hiding. I'm a bit nervous about that, but I'm a bit excited, too. I nod at him, "Very well. I'm an orphan, raised in the church. I didn't learn anything about sex until I turned eighteen, and I had a religious upbringing that made me very sheltered. I only learned about the outside world after

My name is Holo."
He nods, then asks again, "And why are you here?"
What should I say? I don't know what this doctor does, or how much he knows about me. The more I think about it, the less sense it makes. But I have to give it a try...
So I tell him, "Holo is my real name, but I go by 'Mare.'"
He looks confused, "Oh, do you want me to call you Mare instead?"
"No..." I shake my head, "...no, please keep calling me Mare."
Dr. Szozas smiles, "Well, if that's fine with you, Mare, let's get started. What brings you to our little clinic today?"
At this point I realize that I've been staring blankly at the wall, not listening to anything that Dr. Szozas was saying. He continues, "If there's nothing else we can discuss now, would you mind telling me what brought you to see me? Do you feel that something is wrong with you?"
That question catches me off guard, but I answer honestly, "Yes, I'm worried about myself."
Dr. Szozas' face brightens up even further, and I find it hard to believe that I just told a complete stranger that I'm concerned about my own sanity. I wonder what I said to him to elicit such a reaction.
"Do you remember the last time that you felt well?"
This is a very important question. I mustn't forget the details. I mustn't allow myself to drift away into a foggy haze where I lose track of reality.
"Um, the day before yesterday I went to the bathhouse at the end of the village. It was crowded, and I got caught up in the crowd. I lost sight of my surroundings, and I couldn't hear anyone talking to me. I suddenly realized that

My name is Holo."
He nods. And then he asks, "And why do you think you're here?"
So I tell him, "Well, I've been having trouble sleeping lately, and I've had nightmares, which have gotten worse recently..."
"Is this because of work? Or school?"
"Work, yes...school, too..."
He nods again. "Do you mind if we start there? You said you were having dreams. What did they consist of?"
"Um..." My face gets hot. "It was a dream where I was being chased by wolves..."
"Wolves? Do you know what a wolf looks like?"
"...yes, sort of. They looked similar to dogs."
Dr. Szozas smiles. "That sounds like a nightmare. The one about being hunted by wolves can be a common motif in people suffering from anxiety or stress. Are you feeling anxious right now?"
"Yes, I'm afraid to go home alone at night..."
"Why are you worried about going home alone at night?"
"Because I don't want anyone else to get hurt!" I say loudly. "There was a time when I didn't care about anything other than getting stronger and learning more about magic. But I changed after I met Lawrence, and I started thinking about others, about the world outside our village..."
"Have you ever thought about becoming a hunter?"
"A hunter?!" I ask, surprised.
"You mentioned earlier that you used to be a Hunter Knight. Why not become a hunter instead of a merchant? There are plenty of jobs that require a strong body, but also a sharp eye and a keen ear. If you went to the guild, I'd recommend trying out for the position of 'scout.' It would be a good way to find out if you're suited for the job."
"But I wouldn't be able to hunt things that are dangerous..."
"

My name is Lawrence."
He nods and smiles at me again, then looks back at his computer monitor. It appears to have something written there. He taps away at the keyboard for a moment, and then glances up at me once more, "And what brings you here?"
It feels strange answering such questions. But I've got this feeling that if I don't answer them now, they'll keep coming back until I do. "Well...I just..." I stutter, and I can feel myself blushing, "...don't know where else to go."
Dr. Szozas chuckles softly, "You certainly seem lost, Mr. Lawrence." He pauses, and his face becomes serious, "Why did you come to me? What brought you to seek out help?"
"Um, well..." I try to think of an easy way to explain things. "I was having trouble sleeping, and I'd been getting headaches all day. And I had a lot of money problems, and I didn't know if anyone would want to listen to me."
Dr. Szozas nods sympathetically, "That sounds very much like a case of 'sleep debt,' which is quite common among people living alone. Do you sleep well at night?"
"Yes, I used to, but not lately. I haven't slept well at all since I started working at the mine, but I never really noticed because I was too busy."
Dr. Szozas cocks his head at me, "Do you ever wake up and realize that you're not tired, but you still feel exhausted, even though you went to bed at the same time as the last few nights?"
"Yeah, I guess I do that sometimes. I get up from a nap, and I'm not sleepy at all. I just need to lie down. Sometimes I'm up all night, and I don't remember the next morning. I usually work through the whole day

My name is Lawrence."
He nods, then asks, "And why are you here?"
"Well..." I begin hesitantly, "It's hard to explain...but I think something bad happened to me back home. And now I can't get away from it."
"Do tell," he responds readily, leaning forward expectantly.
So I start talking, telling him about the town where I grew up: small rural community, population just under two thousand people. The school there is pretty good, but not great; we don't have much money or resources, so I suppose that makes sense. It would seem that everyone is related to each other, which makes things difficult when one person wants to go off to college and another doesn't want them to. There are only three high schools in the area, and all students from those schools attend our local university together. Our little village is surrounded by farmland, and many families farm their own land. We also grow wheat, corn, soybeans, and potatoes; it's very profitable, so it keeps us fairly well fed.
But the past few years have been rough financially. Our crops were hit with a blight last year, and prices plummeted because farmers couldn't sell anything to the big cities. Prices haven't recovered yet, but they won't be able to recover until the next harvest rolls around.
"There are no jobs in the city; I tried to find work, but nobody will hire me. I'm not sure what I should do," I say, feeling a bit defeated.
Dr. Szozas leans back into his chair, his elbows resting on the arms, his hands folded neatly before his face. "Tell me about the incident that brought you here."
"Oh, right!" I exclaim, "Well, I was walking to the post office to send a letter to my parents when suddenly I felt this intense pain in my head. I was dizzy, and I fell to

*********************************

My name is Holo...and..." I don't know where to begin, so I just blurt out, "I have this problem."
He smiles again, and then leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees, "Holo? What sort of problem?"
It feels strange to talk about myself. My face flushes hot, and I feel embarrassed. I try to get away from the topic, "No, I guess I should start by telling you what happened today. It started with the doctor I saw yesterday, Dr. Fisalis. I was there because I had heard he might be able to help me."
Dr. Szozas nods, "Go ahead."
"So we were talking about how I was feeling really bad, and I mentioned that I was thinking about killing myself, and he said 'You can kill yourself any time.'"
Dr. Szozas raises an eyebrow, "That's quite a leap, isn't it? And from one session to another?"
"Well, I thought maybe I was being overly dramatic, but then I went home, and I realized that I actually felt pretty good. Like, for the first time in a long while."
Dr. Szozas looks at me curiously, "And did you do anything to confirm whether or not you felt better after leaving the office?"
"...Uhh, no, not yet. I still need to go back to the office tomorrow morning to find out if I've been cured or not."
"Hmm, that does sound a little fishy to me. How about if I ask you a question, would that be all right?"
I nod, "Sure."
"Do you think that you are currently depressed, or are you simply having a bad day?"
Oh, I knew that I didn't want to answer that. I am not sure if I'm depressed, but I definitely don't want to admit to him that I am in fact

My name is Myne."
He smiles again, "That's very good. What brings you here today?"
"Well..." I begin, but then pause because I can't quite figure out what to say next. How do I tell this doctor that I've been having strange thoughts? That they have been getting stronger lately, even though I don't think they should be strong enough to cause me concern. But now that I'm sitting across from him, I realize that there's something else wrong too. I feel...off. Something isn't right inside me.
A cold chill runs through me. Is this really happening? Am I seriously meeting with a psychiatrist?! It feels so surreal, yet also oddly real.
Dr. Szozas notices my discomfort and continues to smile gently at me, "Do you want to talk about those feelings, or would you rather just get started with the consultation?"
I nod slowly, "It'd be best if we start with the consultation, yes."
"Then please state your age, height, weight, blood type, eye color, hair color, favorite food, and any other information that may be relevant to our conversation," he requests, and I give all the details to him.
After I finish talking about myself, I ask him, "How long will the session last?"
"If you are willing to stay with me for an hour, I'll be able to answer most questions that you might have. If not, we can shorten the time. I'm sorry, I'm not sure how to estimate the length of the appointment, but I'm guessing that a half-hour is the longest I'm likely to keep a patient for. Do you have anything to add to that, or are you satisfied with the answers that I gave?"
I shake my head, "No, I'm fine with the answers that you gave. I'm happy that I came here today." I try to sound more confident than

My name is Holo."
He nods once, and then asks, "And why do you think you've become obsessed with this?"
This question catches me off guard. I have been thinking all morning about what I would say, and now suddenly I don't know where to start. My mind goes blank. But then...
"Well..." I begin slowly, "It started when I saw the picture of the wolf cubs."
He smiles again, "Yes? Go ahead."
So I continue, "When I was young, I lived alone with my mother after she died giving birth to me. She had a little money saved up, and we bought a farm together. We were happy there. It was peaceful, quiet. And one day, just before spring ended, a pack of wolves came along. They killed our sheep, they ate them alive. When I screamed at them, they turned their backs to us and ran away. That was when I learned that wolves eat people too."
Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding occasionally. I feel myself relaxing more, and I go on. "That night, I went to sleep with a dream: 'Wolf.' Every time I closed my eyes I heard the word. I woke up crying each and every time I did. The next few days, I couldn't get the image out of my head, no matter how hard I tried. I thought I'd lost something precious to me. I'm not sure if I ever really got it back. I still hear the words sometimes, but I can't remember what I dreamed about that night anymore.
"Then I found the web site about the wolf sanctuary. I read about the Wolf Kingdom. I read about the wolves that were rescued from the slaughterhouses and farms that kill animals for food. I read about the Wolves' Paradise that is run by the King himself. I read about how the wolves are raised to be friendly, and how the humans

My name is Lawrence."
He smiles again, and this time there is something different about his expression, his smile is more genuine than before. It's as though all the tension drains away, leaving only warmth behind.
"And why did you want to meet with me?"
Well, I've been thinking about this quite a lot, and I feel like I have to tell somebody. And really, after meeting Dr. Szozas, I don't think I can go back home without having said what needs saying. I sigh, "I...I guess because I'm tired of being alone."
Dr. Szozas looks surprised, then he laughs. He reaches out to pat me on the shoulder, "You aren't alone anymore, are you? That's great news. You know, I've had many clients come to me who were not able to sleep soundly or rest well at night. There are several reasons for that, one being anxiety. But if they do get a good nights sleep, their lives improve dramatically, both physically and mentally. The mind and body are connected, after all.
So, let's start with a few questions to determine what might be causing your insomnia."
We spend the next hour talking about my life, my family, and about myself. We talk about work, about school, about hobbies. I learn a little about his past, too. I find that I enjoy his company, his mannerisms are easygoing, and his conversation is engaging.
It is nearly two hours later when we finish our discussion.
"OK, I'm going to give you a prescription. Take these pills, and call me when you have finished them. I will check up on you periodically to ensure that you are taking the right dosage, but I'll also be available by phone. I'm sure you understand that I cannot prescribe any medication that would affect your ability to drive. If you experience side effects, please contact me immediately.

My name is Lawrence."
He nods, then asks, "And why are you here?"
This feels strange. Why am I telling this stranger all of this? But maybe because we've both been through so much pain and suffering already, I feel compelled to tell him what happened to me. It doesn't seem right to keep any secrets from him now. Maybe there is something else about me that makes me want to open myself up to him completely.
"Well...it started after I went to college..."
"...and became a scholar?"
"Yes, sir."
Dr. Szozas smiles, "You know a lot about theology, don't you?"
"I do. And also medicine, philosophy, economics, literature, history, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, physics, astronomy, chemistry, biology, botany, zoology, geology, geography, archeology, law, politics, ethics, music theory, dance, painting, sculpture, architecture, engineering, metallurgy, mining, agriculture, forestry, ecology, business administration, marketing, management, accounting, finance, commerce, banking, investment, insurance, real estate, religion, spirituality, mysticism, cosmology, metaphysics, and many other things besides."
"Wow!"
Dr. Szozas laughs a little, "So that was a long list!"
"It was indeed!"
Dr. Szozas chuckles again, "That was quite the education. So why did you choose to become a theologian?"
"Because I wanted to study God. Because I believed that if I could understand Him better, I might be able to serve Him more effectively. I believe that if I can truly comprehend the nature of the divine, I will be able to help others find the same peace that I have found."
"Interesting," the psychiatrist murmurs, "Did you ever consider becoming a priest or a monk?"
"No, not really.
