My name is Alexandra." My voice sounds small and quiet in this huge room, so I clear my throat, and try again, "Alexandra Zabrisky."
He nods thoughtfully, then responds, "And what brings you to our practice?"
"Well, I've been having problems with magic lately...it started right after school ended last year." I say quietly, "It feels like something is pulling on me all the time, trying to get inside my head, and I can't control it very well. It's really starting to affect my life."
Dr. Szozas looks pensively off into space for a moment, "Hmm..." He turns back to face me, "Do you have any idea what triggered this change? Was there a particular event or circumstance that caused you to start experiencing these symptoms?"
"No, I don't think so." I reply softly.
"When did they begin?"
"Last week, when we were doing that spell together during lunch period."
Dr. Szozas raises an eyebrow, "A spell?"
"Yeah, one of those 'Let There Be Light' spells. You know, where you draw circles with chalk on the floor and chant incantations while focusing your mind on the light that will appear."
"Oh yeah, I remember that. That was fun!" Dr. Szozas chuckles, and I smile back at him.
"Anyway, I was chanting, and I felt a little strange, but I kept going until I finished the circle. After I was done, I noticed that the hair on the back of my neck was standing up, and I had goosebumps. I was worried that I was getting sick, but I didn't want to stop the spell because I was enjoying it. I was just wondering if I was imagining things, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched by somebody, so I looked around the classroom,

My name is Alexandra Harris."
He nods, "And why did you decide to seek treatment?"
"It started last week, when I went online to check out a few things. It felt weird... Like something wasn't right. I kept thinking 'what if'. But then I got this idea, this crazy idea..."
"Go ahead, please tell me what happened next," he prompts gently.
So I do: "Well, I decided to go to the library today. And I saw her there, she looked just like me. She had long black hair and beautiful green eyes. We talked for awhile, we were getting along really good until I left."
Dr. Szozas listens intently as I recount the details of our encounter. He doesn't interrupt or ask any questions, only stares at me, listening closely. When I finish, he asks softly, "How old are you, Alex? What grade are you in?"
"Eleven," I answer nervously. "Are you sure you want to hear all of this?"
"Yes, yes indeedy," he smiles reassuringly at me, leaning forward slightly to get a better view of my face, his hands resting lightly on the arms of his chair.
"OK, well, um, I guess I'll start at the beginning. My parents died when I was six years old, they both committed suicide together. I was taken by a neighbor to live with them, but I was too young to remember much about that time. I think I was four when I moved back home with my aunt and uncle, but I don't know that either; I was pretty messed up after the move. I spent most of the summer at a mental health facility, and when I returned to school the following year I was very depressed. I was afraid that I would be institutionalized again, but I was lucky that I didn't have to be.
When I turned eighteen I applied for emancipation from

My name is Alexandra Zabini." My hands rest in my lap, palms facing upward. It feels odd to speak my real name aloud after all this time, but there is something comforting about knowing that I can trust him completely. I feel safe in telling him the truth, because I know that I won't get hurt by saying too much or revealing too little. I'll just have to wait until we've gotten started, then figure things out later.
He nods back, waiting patiently, "OK, now tell me what brings you to my office today?"
So I start talking. I explain everything: how I lost control of myself during the game against New York University, how I didn't want to go home afterward, and how I ended up wandering aimlessly through the city streets, trying to find somewhere to sleep. I talk about the web, and the strange feeling of powerlessness I felt when I saw people being killed. How I couldn't stop thinking about killing them, even though I knew that they were innocent.
Dr. Szozas listens attentively to my story without interrupting, nodding along occasionally. He doesn't seem surprised or shocked when I describe the dream where I was a god, but rather, he appears intrigued.
When I finish, he asks, "What do you think about the dreams? Do you remember having them before the game?"
I shake my head no.
"How about the others?"
Again I say no, shaking my head again.
"Alexandra, I'd like to ask you a few questions, if that's OK with you?"
I nod yes.
"Have you ever had any experiences with a 'power' that you weren't aware of, such as telekinesis or levitation?"
I don't really understand the question, but I answer, "Yes."
"Do you recall what happened that day?"
I pause, confused, "Well... I guess I

My name is Alexandra Zabrisk."
He nods, then leans forward slightly, "Alexandra, tell me please what brings you to my office today?"
So I do, telling him all about myself, including my problem: I feel like I have been possessed by something evil, but I can't explain what it is exactly. He listens intently, nodding occasionally, asking questions now and again, and finally he asks me to describe what happened when I felt this way before.
"It started yesterday afternoon after school ended, I got home...and nothing seemed right..."
Dr. Szozas looks at me carefully, "And did anything happen during class? Any other odd occurrences? Did anyone else seem to react strangely to you?"
"No, just me. No one else noticed or reacted to me in any way. It was really strange because normally people would ask me questions or talk to me. But not yesterday, they were all too busy watching TV or playing computer games or texting their friends. And no one even said hi to me when I walked past them on the bus ride home."
Dr. Szozas smiles at me reassuringly, "That's very normal behavior; everyone is preoccupied with their own lives lately. That is perfectly understandable."
I nod, relieved that I wasn't the only weirdo out there.
"Do you know where you live? Do you remember what neighborhood it is?"
"Yes, I'm at the corner of Elm Street and Maple Lane. I'm sure I've lived here since I was a baby, I'm pretty sure I'm twelve years old. I was born and raised here; I went to the local elementary, middle, and high schools, and I graduated from the university last year with a degree in business administration with a minor in marketing. I'm a senior at the moment, but I won't graduate until next month."
"Hmm, I see," Dr. Szozas

Alexandra Victoria Alexandra." And then pause again, trying to decide whether or not to tell this stranger more than just my name. But there isn't any harm in telling him about myself, right? Right? "My family moved away from home when I was young. My parents divorced, and they both remarried. Now I live alone with my cat." I don't know where I got the idea that psychiatrists always want to hear about your childhood traumas.
He nods thoughtfully, "And how old are you?"
"Twenty-one years old."
"Hmm...okay..." He pauses for a moment, thinking, before continuing, "How long have you been living by yourself?"
"About three months now. It took me awhile to get used to being alone."
"Do you feel lonely?"
"Yes. Sometimes I do."
"Have you ever felt depressed or hopeless?"
"Sometimes."
"What makes you happy?"
"Pets. The internet. Reading a good book." I think back to what I've done today; I ate lunch at the diner, had a few beers with friends, went to work, and then came up here to meet with Dr. Szozas. I haven't even watched TV yet.
"Are you currently taking medication, and if so, which ones?"
"No, I don't need them."
"That's interesting. Do you smoke cigarettes?"
"Occasionally, but not very often."
"You seem to be doing well. Your vitals are all within normal parameters. You're not overweight, you're healthy. I'm going to recommend that you continue seeing me once per week, for the next month. At the end of the month, we'll review the situation together, and I'll be able to determine if you should continue with our sessions. Would that be alright with you?"
"Sure!" I say enthusiastically. I am relieved

My name is Alexandra Zabrisk."
He nods, taking notes, "And why are you here?"
"Because... because..."
"Yes, yes, let's start there. Why do you think you are here? What makes you feel this way?"
"Well, I don't know exactly. It just feels like something is wrong inside me, and I can't figure out what it is."
"Hmmmmm, have you ever felt anxious or worried about anything before?"
"Not really, no. I've always been able to control myself pretty easily."
"Do you recall any recent events or situations where you might have experienced anxiety or worry?"
"No, not really. Just things that happened back home."
"What kinds of things did happen back home?"
"Well, nothing specific, but people were getting sick all the time. The flu was rampant, and we had a lot of bad weather too, lots of tornadoes and hurricanes. People died all the time."
"So, are you saying that your parents are dead?"
"No, they're alive and well. They live in Florida now, I haven't seen them in years though."
Dr. Szozas frowns slightly, "Alexandra, are you sure about that? Have you tried contacting them recently?"
"Um, no, I didn't even realize that I hadn't spoken to them in a long while. I'm sorry, I'm sure that's the case. I'm sure I'll hear from them soon enough."
"Alright, alright, that's fine. So, when was the last time that you spoke with your parents?"
"It was about a year ago, right after I graduated high school. I was planning to visit them when I got a scholarship to go to college, but I never made it to Florida. I'm sure that I'll get a chance to talk to them again one day. I'm

Alexandra Alexandra Dzubay." I pause again, trying to gather my thoughts. This isn't easy for me to do, because I don't really know where to start. The last few days have been very confusing for me, and I just want this all to stop. But I can't stop it now, and I need to get it off my chest, "Look...I think something strange is happening to me..." My words trail away after that sentence, and I stare vacantly at nothingness for several seconds before continuing, "...and I've been thinking about seeing a doctor about it."
Dr. Szozas smiles gently, "OK Alex, tell me what happened."
So I try to explain myself: "Well, yesterday morning I woke up, and I had a terrible headache, which I'd never felt before. It was pounding in my skull, and I couldn't stand it anymore. So I got up, went to the bathroom, took two aspirin, drank a glass of water, then I walked out into the kitchen and made breakfast. And when I came back downstairs, the pain was gone!"
He listens patiently to my story, nodding occasionally, asking questions if necessary. "And did you feel any different afterwards?"
"No, not at all."
"What about today? Has anything changed since yesterday?"
"Yes, I guess so. I haven't slept much, and I'm feeling pretty tired. I tried to go to sleep early tonight, but I kept waking up. I'm having trouble concentrating, and I keep zoning out. I'm not sure how to describe it, but it's frustrating."
"Anything else?"
"Um, yeah, I'm hungry. I'm always hungry. I eat a lot, and I'm constantly craving food. I'm even dreaming about food at night sometimes. I used to be able to control that with magic, but I'm losing that ability too. I don't

My name is Alexandra Zabrisk."
He nods encouragingly, "And why are you here?"
Oh god... this guy knows what happened to me, doesn't he? Did I mention something about my family history? No, wait... maybe I didn't tell him anything about my past yet. Maybe I should just start there. How do I explain all of this without sounding crazy? My mind races. What if he thinks I'm insane? Or worse, that I'm dangerous? The thought makes me shiver.
"Well..." I begin hesitantly, "You know that I have magic powers, right?"
He smiles again, "Yes, we've already established that."
What does he mean by 'we'? Who else is involved in this? Why can't I remember any names or faces? Is this another one of those memories that will disappear if I try too hard to recall them?
"So, I was having a bad day yesterday, and I had trouble sleeping last night. And then today when I woke up I felt really strange, and I started thinking about things that were happening in my life recently, and I got scared, because they seemed more important than usual."
Dr. Szozas looks puzzled, "Scared of what exactly?"
"Things that I haven't been able to control. Like I said before, I don't feel very good about myself lately. I think I might be losing touch with reality. I mean, I've always known that I'm different from other people, but now I feel like I'm starting to lose it. I'm not sure that I want to be normal anymore. I want to be special, I guess. I want to be a wizard. I want to be a powerful mage with awesome spells, and I want to be the best. I'm tired of being average. I'm tired of feeling powerless. I need help. I need to be saved!"

My name is Alexandra Zabrisk."
He nods, slowly, and then asks, "What brings you here?"
Now I know what this is all about, because he knows about Harry Potter, right? That's what I thought too, until I noticed the bookcase, which contains several volumes by JK Rowling. The books are stacked neatly, and they are labeled alphabetically, except one volume is titled 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'. I pick up the cover and flip through it, and find myself reading the title page:
'To Alex - For Everything.'
And under that, it reads:
'All things considered, we've had a pretty good life together. You were always there for me when I needed you most, and I hope that I was able to do the same for you. Love Always, Mom & Dad.'
A tear rolls down my cheek as I stare at the words written across the pages. It feels like somebody punched me in the gut, and yet it also feels like an incredible relief, knowing that I have finally found the answer to what's happening with me.
Dr. Szozas notices my reaction, "Alexandra, are you alright?"
I nod, and I wipe the tears off my cheeks, "Yes...yes I am. Thank you, doctor, I'm sorry..."
He smiles, and reaches out to pat me gently on the shoulder, "It's okay, I understand completely. I can't imagine the pain that you must be feeling right now."
"No, I don't think anyone ever really understands the feelings that I'm experiencing at any given moment," I tell him, and I look away, ashamed.
"That is very true. And I'm not sure that I would be a suitable therapist to help you with those issues. But I am going to be a sounding board for you, and I will listen to anything that you want to discuss with me,"

My name is Alexandra Zarev."
He nods, slowly, and then turns back to face me, "And why have you sought treatment?"
Oh god, this is hard. How do I explain? What can I tell him?
So I begin: "Well, uh... I've been having trouble sleeping lately..."
Dr. Szozas chuckles, "That sounds like a common problem. Do you mind if I ask what you were doing before bedtime?"
"No, not really."
"Have you ever had any problems falling asleep or staying asleep?"
"Not really. It just happens sometimes, especially when I'm anxious or stressed."
"Do you often experience nightmares?"
"Sometimes."
"What sort of dreams do you have?"
"Um, mostly bad ones. Mostly about being attacked by monsters, things trying to eat me, people chasing after me, stuff like that. And I guess I dream a lot about school, because there are always tests to study for, or something else that needs to get done."
"Are you afraid of anything in particular?"
"Yeah, I think I'm afraid of getting hurt, maybe dying even. That's probably the most common nightmare I have."
Dr. Szozas pauses, and his smile grows wider, "Alexandra, I'd say that is a very typical reaction to stress. I'll bet that you feel helpless when you wake up from a scary dream; you feel powerless to stop whatever is happening to you."
"Yes!" I exclaim, "Exactly!"
Dr. Szozas continues: "Your subconscious is reacting to the anxiety, but when you awake, that fear is turned into a dream. When you are dreaming, it is easier to believe that the threat is real, and that the outcome is inevitable, than when you are awake. In other words, the more frightened you are when you are awake, the worse the dreams will be
