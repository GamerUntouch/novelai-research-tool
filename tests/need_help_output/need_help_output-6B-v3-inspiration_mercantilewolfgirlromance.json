    " sounds like a nightmare. The one about being hunted by wolves can be a common motif in people suffering from anxiety or stress. Are you feeling anxious right now?\"\n\"Yes, I'm afraid to",
    " go home alone at night...\"\n\"Why are you worried about going home alone at night?\"\n\"Because I don't want anyone else to get hurt!\" I say loudly. \"There was a",
    " time when I didn't care about anything other than getting stronger and learning more about magic. But I changed after I met Lawrence, and I started thinking about others, about the world outside our village...\"",
    "\n\"Have you ever thought about becoming a hunter?\"\n\"A hunter?!\" I ask, surprised.\n\"You mentioned earlier that you used to be a Hunter Knight. Why not become a hunter",
    " instead of a merchant? There are plenty of jobs that require a strong body, but also a sharp eye and a keen ear. If you went to the guild, I'd recommend trying out for the",
    " position of 'scout.' It would be a good way to find out if you're suited for the job.\"\n\"But I wouldn't be able to hunt things that are dangerous...\"\n\""

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

And really, after meeting Dr. Szozas, I don't think I can go back home without having said what needs saying. I sigh, \"I...I guess because I'm tired of being alone.\"\nDr. Szozas looks surprised, then he laughs. He reaches out to pat me on the shoulder, \"You aren't alone anymore, are you? That's great news. You know, I've had many clients come to me who were not able to sleep soundly or rest well at night. There are several reasons for that, one being anxiety. But if they do get a good nights sleep, their lives improve dramatically, both physically and mentally. The mind and body are connected, after all.\nSo, let's start with a few questions to determine what might be causing your insomnia.\"\nWe spend the next hour talking about my life, my family, and about myself. We talk about work, about school, about hobbies. I learn a little about his past, too. I find that I enjoy his company, his mannerisms are easygoing, and his conversation is engaging.\nIt is nearly two hours later when we finish our discussion.\n\"OK, I'm going to give you a prescription. Take these pills, and call me when you have finished them. I will check up on you periodically to ensure that you are taking the right dosage, but I'll also be available by phone.
