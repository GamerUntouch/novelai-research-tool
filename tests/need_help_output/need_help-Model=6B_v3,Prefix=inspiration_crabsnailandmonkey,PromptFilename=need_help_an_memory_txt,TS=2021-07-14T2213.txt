=== Prompt ========================================
I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
[Period: Modern Day]
[Year: 2020 AD]
[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "


=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Kanbaru Nagase."
"Kanbaru...Nagase? Why do you have such a strange last name?"
"It used to be Hanekawa before I changed it..."
"Oh, I've heard about her. She's quite famous, isn't she? A very talented young woman. You don't seem too much different than her. But please tell me more about yourself. How old are you, what year were you born, where did you go to school, who was your favorite teacher, and anything else you'd care to share. It'll only take five minutes."
He listens attentively as I talk for a while. When I finish, he asks, "Do you know how long this will take?"
I shake my head.
"How many times do you want to try again?"
"...Once would be fine."
"Very well. Let us begin. Please remove all items of clothing except those on your feet. Do not worry if they get caught on something. The session is being recorded, and I will review the video after we're done. I recommend that you not wear underwear, but that is optional. Is there anything else that you need to bring?"
I feel my cheeks getting hot, and I answer, "No, I think I can manage on my own."
I stand up, and I start to unbutton my blouse. I lift my arms, and I pull my shirt up and off. My bra is next, and I peel it away. I turn my back to him, and I reach behind my back to unhook my skirt, and I let it slide down my legs. I step out of my shoes, and I place them on the floor.
I am now completely naked from the waist up. I turn around to face Dr. Szozas, and I reach out to hold my hands together in front of me.
Dr. Szoz

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Araragi Koyomi."
He nods. "And why do you think you should see me?"
"Because... because..." I don't know what to say. My mind goes blank.
"...You seem to have problems sleeping, right? You've been getting headaches, too, haven't you? And you feel tired all the time, and sometimes you even lose track of things you were doing before, and forget where you put them after. Do you get hungry often, or thirsty?"
I nod silently. It feels like there is something pressing against my chest, but I can't tell if it's anxiety, sadness, or just the air itself.
"It sounds like a case of sleep deprivation to me. I'll prescribe you some medication for it, okay?"
"What will happen then?"
"That depends on the severity of the condition. If the symptoms persist, I might recommend more treatment, perhaps cognitive behavioral therapy. But I'd like to talk about the root cause, first. What exactly is causing this to happen to you?"
I answer honestly, "I don't really know myself. I woke up one morning feeling different, and I couldn't go back to sleep. After that I kept waking up in the middle of the night, and I never got to sleep again. I'm always sleepy, and I find it hard to concentrate, I guess."
Dr. Szozas smiles, "Well, that certainly does sound like a lot of trouble. I'm not sure I understand the details, but I suppose it's possible that you're suffering from insomnia due to stress. Have you ever felt stressed out recently?"
I shake my head.
"Have you experienced any major changes in your life recently?"
I shrug.
"Do you live alone?"
I nod.
"Are you in a relationship?"
I shake my head.
"Then I'm afraid I don't really know

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Araragi Hachikuji. I've been seeing a counselor named Doctor M."
Dr. Szozas looks confused, but nods along, "And why have you seen this counselor?"
I pause, then answer, "Because I don't know what's wrong with me... It feels like something inside me is broken, but I can't tell where or how..."
He smiles, "That sounds very similar to a case I had once before, about five years ago. I remember her quite vividly. She came in with exactly the same symptoms. Do you mind if I ask? What did she say was the cause of her problems?"
"She said there were three people that were causing trouble for her, a girl called Ogi Oshinoâ”€and two boys, Tsukihi Kitanaka and Hanekawa Senjogahara. They seemed to be the source of the problem."
"Three individuals, huh. Well, I suppose I should start by asking you, Araragi, do you feel any sense of unease or fear when you think about the word 'counselor?'"
"No, not at all. I guess I just assumed that the person I'd met would be a woman, and I wouldn't have felt uneasy at the thought of talking to a man. I didn't even consider the possibility that I might meet a man, or a woman, in a counseling session. My mistake, I suppose."
"Hmm, I see. And yet, I am a man. In fact, I'm a psychiatrist, a therapist, and a counselor, and I'm a man.  You are aware, I hope, that we live in a society in which gender is not a factor in our daily lives. That's the way things used to be, back when you were young, and I still find myself surprised when I hear of a boy or a girl being referred to as such.

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Araragi Hachikuji. I'm sixteen years old, and I've been having trouble sleeping lately."
He nods, "I understand. That sounds very much like insomnia."
It does? It really does?! I nod back at him, "Yes, sir...but there's something else..."
"What might that be?"
"Well, sometimes during the day I feel this sense of unease or anxiety, and I can't tell what exactly it is, but I think maybe it has something to do with the fact that I used to have a sister."
Dr. Szozas furrows his brows, "A younger sister?"
"Yeah, she died three years ago."
"Oh my goodness. I'm sorry for asking such a personal question," he apologizes, and then looks at me, "So you don't know if it was a sudden illness or accident or if she was murdered, right?"
I shake my head, "I don't. I only know that I haven't seen her since then."
"I see. So, if I may ask, where did the deceased live, and were they related to you by blood or marriage or any other means?"
I answer, "She lived in the same apartment building as my family, and we went to the same school. Her name was Hitagi Senjogahara."
"...And was the deceased a close friend of yours?"
I nod, "We were friends. We weren't siblings or anything, though. She wasn't my real older sister. I never had a brother, either. My parents divorced when I was young, and my father remarried. He adopted a son from overseas, and I ended up living in his house instead of mine. But my mother didn't like me being all alone, so she sent me to the local public elementary school while my new stepbrother stayed at home with his dad.

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Hachikuji Koyomi."
"Why do you feel compelled to seek counseling?"
"Um... I don't know..."
He smiles again, and this time there is a touch of sadness in his face, "It's ok if you can't tell me right away. It'll probably all become clear once we start talking."
"Oh, um... Well, I've been having problems lately, and I think I might need help dealing with them."
Dr. Szozas nods, and looks at me carefully, then asks, "Do you want to talk about what happened last night? Or do you prefer to wait until later in the week?"
Last night?! I had completely forgotten that I'd gone out for a walk. "Well, I guess I should start by telling you the events of the day before yesterday, I was walking home when I heard a scream, and when I got back to where I live, I found a girl lying on the ground, unconscious. I checked her pulse, and she seemed to have a weak one, but I didn't find any obvious wounds or injuries. I tried calling out for help, but nobody came. I thought I was the only person in the area, so I decided to call the police. The dispatcher said they would send an ambulance, and I waited for an hour or two but no ambulance showed up. I went to the hospital, and I was informed that the girl was dead. I was told the cause of death was a heart attack, and I just couldn't believe it. I wanted to go check on the body, and I did, and sure enough, the girl was indeed deceased. I felt bad for the family, and I left the scene after a while.
I walked home, feeling pretty depressed and confused. I wasn't really thinking clearly at the time, and I kept replaying the whole incident in my head, wondering if I was wrong or not

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Hachikuji."
He nods, then continues, "And tell me about this problem that you have, Hachi..."
Oh, right, I forgot to mention... My name isn't actually Hachikuji. It's Araragi-senpai, but the doctor calls me by my nickname. I don't mind though, since I've been called by that nickname ever since elementary school, and it's gotten worse lately thanks to Senjogahara being such a pain in the ass. 
"Hm? Oh yes, I was just thinking that we should get started soon, given our time constraints. Tell me, what is troubling you?"
I'd rather not say anything at all, but I can't lie to him, either. And I do want to talk about it. "Um, I think I might be a little depressed. That's probably a bad way to put it, but I feel kind of down. Like I'm always getting stuck in a rut, and I can't seem to break out of it. I'm afraid I'll never find happiness again, or something along those lines."
Dr. Szozas smiles, "That sounds exactly like the symptoms of depression, doesn't it. So, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I hope you won't hold back. Please answer honestly, and without any reservation. You may be surprised at the results. I'm sure there are many people who would prefer to avoid facing their problems head-on, but I am not one of them. We will face things together, and I promise I will help you in whatever way I can."
He looks at me earnestly, and I nod.
Dr. Szozas begins his questioning: "What is your current age, Hachi-chan?"
I answer, "Twenty-one years old. I graduated from high school two months ago, and I'm currently

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Hachikuji, and I'm a ghost."
Hm? What did he say?"
"A ghost... Aha hahaha..."
Ah yes, that explains it. This doctor does specialize in unusual cases.
He sits back in his chair, and looks at me quizzically.
"So what brings you to this clinic today?"
"Well, uh, there was something I wanted to ask about ghosts, but I guess I can start by telling you more about myself first."
"That sounds good. Please go ahead."
"OK then, um, I died when I was young. My parents had been killed in a traffic accident, and I was left all alone, and that's when I became a ghost. Well, actually, I don't know if I really 'became a ghost,' because my body isn't dead at all. It just doesn't exist anymore. But I've seen things, heard voices, and I feel the presence of other people, and they sometimes talk to me. They tell me their stories. And I listen, and try to help them. So I guess I'm a ghost, after all. I'm not sure if I should call myself a soul or a spirit or whatever, though. I have no idea what I am. I think I might be a reincarnation, or maybe a ghost, or a shadow, or a phantom, or a specter, or a shade, or a wraith, or a ghoul, a revenant, a wraith, a spectre, a phantasm, a shad, a wrait, a wisp, a vengeful apparition, a mourner, a wandering spirit, a walking corpse, a lost soul, a deceased spirit, an incorporeal being, a disembodied existence, a lingering personality, a non-corporal entity, a quasi-spiritual phenomenon, a transient spiritual manifestation,

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Araragi Koyomi. And I've been having trouble sleeping recently."
He responds, "That's quite alright, we can start there. What do you have trouble sleeping about?"
"Well..." I say, "it's hard to explain, but... I feel anxious whenever I sleep. It feels like I'll never wake up again."
"Oh, I see. That sounds very stressful. Do you want to talk more about this? Would you prefer to speak in private?"
I shake my head. "No, I think I'd rather stay in the open, if possible."
"Alright then, let's get started. How long have you had a problem with insomnia?"
"About two months now."
"Hmm... You said earlier that you were feeling stressed out before, correct? Are those feelings still present today?"
I nod.
"Have they gotten worse or better since you began suffering from sleeplessness?"
"Worse, I guess. They used to be bearable, and now I just can't stop thinking about them."
"I see. Have you tried any other methods for dealing with the stress, such as exercise or meditation?"
I thought for a moment. "I did try getting a dog, but I couldn't handle the responsibility, so I gave up on it. I was also taking part in a lot of extracurricular activities, and I was trying to find time to study, and I was doing pretty well until I got sick. I'm sorry, I'm not sure what to tell you."
"You don't need to apologize. Please continue answering my questions. I would be happy to help you in whatever way I can," he assures me.
I sigh, "I went to a doctor once, for some medicine, and I was told to take a break from school because of my condition. I'm still recovering, and I'm really worried about

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Araragi Koyomi."
He nods, taking notes. "And why have you sought counseling?"
"...Because...because..." I can't get any words past the lump in my throat.
"Why do you feel you need therapy? What is troubling you? Do you want to talk about something specific?"
What's there to say? I don't know. But I nod.
"You may speak freely, I won't judge you. If you wish, we can use this session to discuss anything at all."
That's good. That sounds reassuring. I think back to the things that happened during spring break. I remember the time I got lost on my way home after school, and ended up getting assaulted by a vampireâ”€and then again when Hanekawa dragged me along to meet up with Hachikuji and her family. I also recall the incident at the hospital when I was trying to save a girl I'd just met, and she turned out to be a god. And the events at the shrine when the two gods and goddesses were involved.
There was a lot.
But none of them was enough to bring me to tears.
I was able to handle most of the incidents, but I couldn't deal with the ones where I was helpless.
So maybe I wanted to try and find out if I was capable of dealing with those kinds of situations.
I didn't really expect to cry at the counselor's office, though.
"I'm sorry, I'm not crying because I'm sad or anything, I'm just a little nervous. It was a long trip to come up here, and I haven't been to a psychiatrist before, so I thought I should be prepared for whatever happens," I explain.
Dr. Szozas nods, and he doesn't seem surprised. He asks, "Are you sure you've never had a problem like this before?"
I shake my head

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Hachikuji. My family moved away from home a few years ago."
He nods, and looks back at me, waiting patiently.
"Um... I've been seeing a doctor named Kagenuiâ”€for issues related to this case. She said I needed to go somewhere else, though she didn't say where..."
"Ah, yes, I know Ms. Kagenui. The two of us have worked together before, but I'll leave her off the hook for now. It sounds like she simply wasn't able to provide any information on your situation, correct?"
"Yes. That's what she said. But I don't understand why I need to talk to another therapist. Can't you tell me what the problem is? Or at least give me a hint?"
"Well, I'm afraid I can't do either of those things. You see, I'm not a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist. I only practice in a very specialized field, which means that I am unable to diagnose or treat you or anyone else. I am a counselor, however, and as such, I will help you through the process of sorting out whatever is troubling you, and then we can move on from there. If I may ask, did you come to me because you were referred by a friend or relative, or perhaps a school counselor or teacher, or maybe a classmate?"
"Nope, I came to you on my own. I was just browsing the internet, and I found a website for a counselor, and I thought I'd check out their services. I think they recommended you, actually. I guess I was hoping that you might be able to help me figure out my problems, or at least point me in the right direction."
Dr. Szozas nodded. "I see. Well, I suppose I should get started, so let's start at the beginning. What exactly is it you want to talk about, and how
