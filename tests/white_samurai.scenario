  "prompt": "After long service, the memory of my dead wife doesn’t cause a pang in my heart when I see a pretty desirable woman. The Shogun had generously allowed me time off from training his soldiers so that I could find a woman. So now I’m in Kyoto's yūkaku, a Red Light District, looking for an okiya, a Japanese pleasure house, with a pretty girl that I could have fun with. The street is very quiet tonight, and the red lanterns that give the district its names are lit. There aren't many lights on or people out walking at this time of night, so it looks like most of the residents are either home getting ready for bed, or just gone to some other location.  Not too far away from here, there is an old shrine on a hill that overlooks the city, but not to worry about that for now.  This is where I need to be, not to worry about anything else.\nAhead of me, there is a short, narrow alleyway between two buildings. It isn't crowded here, as I've seen no one since coming to this side of town. As I'm walking down this narrow alleyway, I can hear soft music emanating from somewhere inside a building along the way. A light shines through a gap in the door to a house opposite me, and I notice that there are quite a few windows open above it, which means someone is probably playing music and enjoying themselves inside. I look for the sign that might indicate that it’s an okiya where I might find an oiran or yūjo. The kanji characters confirm my suspicion, and I knock politely at the door.",

The garment is trimmed in white silk so thin that I can see through it easily, but it is very tight against her curves and hugs her every contour.  As I look at her more closely, I notice that she has the most beautifully formed face I've ever seen.  Her nose is straight and slightly aquiline, with full, pouting lips and large eyes rimmed with long lashes. Her cheeks are round, with soft creases radiating out from her mouth and running down to her chin. Her features are framed by thick, wavy locks of deep jet-black hair that fall halfway down her back.\nWhen she smiles at me and shows off the perfect whiteness of her teeth, her personality shines forth and I am immediately captivated.

A quaint narrow street dotted with numerous restaurants, shops and ryokans leads you to the temple’s enchanting main gate. Occupying an area of about 35,000 square meters, the temple complex of Kiyomizu comprises more than 30 structures. The major draw of the temple is undeniably its main hall, Hondo, where Kannon Bodhisattva – the main deity of the temple – is housed.\n[ Kiyomizu is one of the temples in Kyoto. ]",
