Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

That I had nightmares where I was being raped by a demon, and then I saw another one, only this time it was a man raping me instead of a monster. And I'd seen other demons too, running away from something, or fighting each other...\nBut I don't want to freak out this nice guy. He doesn't seem mad at me, not yet anyway. So I just give him a brief synopsis: \"Well, basically I've been seeing monsters and demons in my sleep. It started when I was driving home from work, and I was really tired. The next thing I knew, I was dreaming about a giant wolf chasing after me, and when I woke up I realized that the car radio was playing music at a high volume. But it wasn't until later that night that I remembered the dream, and went to turn the radio off...\"\nDr. Szozas smiles at me, \"That sounds very typical to me. Are there any others that stand out, that you remember more clearly than the rest?\"\nI shake my head, \"No, none that I can think of right now. There's a few that are kind of vague though.
