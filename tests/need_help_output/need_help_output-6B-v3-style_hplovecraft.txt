My name is Elizabeth Sizemore." My heart flutters as I speak her name aloud: it feels strange, almost foreign to say it myself. But Dr. Szozas nods approvingly, then asks, "And why do we meet?"
He looks at me expectantly, waiting for my answer. It is hard to find words. I want to tell him that I feel weird, and that something is wrong with me, but I can't quite put those feelings into words. Instead I settle for saying, "I think... I may have been abducted by aliens."
Dr. Szozas laughs. He leans back against his chair, putting his hands together under his chin, and chuckles, "That's good enough reason for any visit!" His laugh continues until he gets control of himself, and his face turns serious again. "Tell me what happened," he prompts.
So I begin telling him about the abduction, and how it felt, and all the things I've seen since. I'm surprised when I finish describing the whole experience, because I realize that Dr. Szozas is not laughing anymore. In fact, he's staring at me intently, and his expression is one of deep concern. When I finish the story, he sits forward, elbows resting on his knees, "Do you mind if I ask a few questions? Just to get the facts straight. What year were you born?"
"1946."
"You don't remember being taken before, or anything about the time leading up to the event itself?"
"No, nothing. I was just walking home from school after gym class. I was twelve years old. I was talking to my friend Brenda, who was also going to be late to pick me up, but she had to go to the bathroom first. I was standing outside the girls' restroom, chatting with her, but I was distracted, thinking about a boy I liked. I must have looked pretty

My name is Mary...Mary Smith."
He nods, then asks, "And what brings you to our offices?"
So I tell him: I've been having nightmares about strange creatures attacking people in broad daylight, but they can't touch me because of the armor I wear. It sounds ridiculous when I say this, but I believe it happened. The last few nights have become progressively more vivid, and frightening. My sleep patterns have also changed drastically, I wake up several times during the night. I feel different, but don't know if there is any way to explain what I'm feeling. When I go to work, I'm distracted by odd thoughts, and I startle easily. And now I fear that I may be losing control of myself.
Dr. Szozas listens intently as I speak, nodding occasionally when I finish. He thinks silently for a moment before responding. "Tell me about the dreams you were describing."
So I do. They started a couple weeks ago, after I had an argument with my boyfriend (which is normal). I woke up crying one morning, thinking about him. In the dream, he was being attacked by those weird things that I keep seeing in my head. But I couldn't move, or help him, or even get out of bed to run outside. I just sat there watching helplessly. I felt terrible.
"Do you recall the details of the dream? Was anyone else present?"
Oh yes, I remember that I wasn't alone; I think I saw a girl or two, maybe a boy too. I tried to scream to warn them, but nothing came out. I didn't want to be left behind, but I knew I wouldn't be able to help if I got out of bed. I wanted to cry, but I was trapped inside the nightmare. I still haven't slept well since the incident, and I'm afraid I'll lose it again if I don't figure out what's

My name is Lisa Marie."
He nods approvingly, "That's very good. Now tell me what brings you here today?"
I feel myself relax even more, because this guy sounds just like Dr. John Watson, the Sherlock Holmes character portrayed by Jeremy Brett in the BBC series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1984-1986). Dr. Watson had been such a great role model for me growing up, and now Dr. Szozas sounds exactly like him. But then again, maybe I've always wanted to meet a real life version of Dr. Watson?
I begin hesitantly, "Well... I'm not sure if there's anything wrong with me, really..."
Dr. Szozas raises an eyebrow, "...but you say you're 'not sure'. What do you think might be happening to you?"
I pause, unsure of where to start, "It started yesterday morning when I woke up early, and went online to check the web. That's all I did, until about noon or so, and then I felt strange and tired, so I took a nap. When I awoke, the feeling was still there, but it wasn't so bad anymore, and I decided to go back online. And that's what I'm doing right now, checking the web, reading emails, etcetera. It feels good, though!"
"OK, so that's one symptom. Anything else?"
"Um, well, I can't seem to get enough sleep. I have trouble falling asleep at night, but I'm wide awake during the day! I guess that makes sense, I'm probably exhausted!"
"And that's another symptom. How about any other symptoms?"
"Oh, I don't know... I'm having a lot of difficulty concentrating, I find it hard to focus on things I'm interested in, I keep thinking about something that happened last week, but I'm afraid to remember it, because I'd rather

My name is Katherine." My cheeks flush slightly, embarrassed by my confession. "And...well..."
He smiles again, "Go ahead," he encourages gently.
"Well, um, I've been having nightmares since last night," I say quietly, feeling ashamed for bringing this matter up.
"Nightmares?" he asks.
"Yes, they started after I looked through the web site," I confess.
"What were the dreams about? Did anything seem particularly frightening to you?" he inquires carefully.
"No, nothing specific really," I answer hesitantly.
"Did you have any strange premonitions before the nightmare began?" he presses further.
"Strange premonitions?" I ask.
"Were there things happening or events occurring that seemed odd to you?" he continues.
"Odd?" I query.
"For example, did something happen recently that seemed very important to you?" he probes.
"Oh yes, lots happened lately," I reply honestly.
"So tell me about those 'lots,'" he requests patiently.
"Okay, well, I got married a month ago to Jeff," I begin slowly, not wanting to upset the doctor somehow.
"That was a good choice!" he responds enthusiastically.
"Thanks," I smile weakly.
"Are you happy with that decision?" he asks kindly.
"Um, yeah, I think so," I admit nervously.
"Was the wedding ceremony a success?" he prompts.
"Yeah, I guess so," I agree cautiously.
"Do you feel satisfied with the results of the marriage?" he continues.
"Uh-huh," I respond with more confidence now.
"Have you had sex yet with your new husband?" he queries bluntly.
"Umm, no," I blush.
"How about with the other man, the one that was at the wedding, the groom, the man that

My name is Rebecca Baker, I don't know why I came here." My hands lie limp between my legs, feeling useless while Dr. Szozas sits there watching me intently.
He nods, and asks, "How long have you been experiencing this problem?"
"It started after reading a story online...about a woman named Bethany who had similar problems..." I begin hesitantly.
Dr. Szozas listens attentively, then smiles gently, "Yes, I've heard about her. She wrote a blog post describing her experience, which got quite a lot of attention."
A wave of relief surges through me, "Oh good, she did write something about this. That means others have experienced the same thing, and maybe they can help me figure out what's wrong with me."
Dr. Szozas raises an eyebrow, "Are you sure? It sounds like you already tried to solve your own problem by reading a website. Did that work out well for you?"
I shrug, "Not really. I didn't get much information from the site, just theories that weren't helpful to me personally."
"You mentioned that you were having trouble sleeping. How would you describe your sleep patterns now?"
I think about it, "Well, I used to be a light sleeper; I'd wake up at any little sound or movement. Now I still do that, but I also find myself waking up earlier than I should. I'm not tired, but I'm awake. I feel restless, anxious, I want to be doing things or I'm worried about being alone with the thoughts that keep me up. I'm not even certain if I'm actually asleep. I'm aware that I'm not fully present when I'm dreaming, but I'm unable to control my dreams. They seem so real, but I'm unsure if I am actually dreaming, or I am simply reliving a memory. I am often afraid that I will

My name is Emily Lively, I'm 22 years old."
He nods, "Go ahead..."
So I continue, "Well... I guess I should start by telling you what's been happening to me. It started two weeks ago, after a party where we drank too much. I woke up feeling sick and tired, and I had this really bad headache. I went home, took a nap, and then slept all day yesterday. My parents came back to get me because they were worried that something might have happened to me, but I wasn't there. They called the police, and they found me sleeping on the floor outside my apartment building. When I woke up again, I felt better than before, but now I feel strange. There's a lot of stuff going through my head, and sometimes I can't concentrate properly. I keep thinking about things that don't seem important, or even real. I know it sounds crazy, but I just want help figuring out what's wrong with me."
Dr. Szozas smiles reassuringly, "Emily, you are far from being crazy, you are experiencing an acute episode of sleepwalking. Sleepwalking is a very common condition, and usually resolves itself within three months. You need to relax, and try not to worry about it too much; I will give you a prescription that will help you sleep more soundly, and hopefully, your episodes of sleepwalking will stop altogether. But if they do not, please understand that I am not responsible for any damages to property that may occur while you are walking during a night time episode."
I nod, relieved that I won't be arrested.
"OK, let's talk about the medication that I am prescribing for you; it is a mild sedative, but I am sure that you'll find that the side effects are worth the benefits. Let me prescribe you a pill that I think is a good match for your symptoms, and I would appreciate if you'd

My name is Jennifer, and I'm here because I don't know what's happening to me."
He nods, "Go ahead."
"Well...it started last night..."
"Last night?"
"...when I got home from work."
"You were working late?"
"Yes, I had been invited by one of our clients to join them at their corporate retreat this weekend. It was supposed to start today, but then they called us to tell us we'd have to postpone until next week due to some unexpected issues."
"What time did you get home?"
"Around 11:30pm. I stopped off at the grocery store before heading home, and I went straight to bed. When I woke up, it was still dark outside. The alarm clock was flashing 12:00. I checked the weather report, and it said there would be a storm tonight. I thought maybe I should go back to sleep, but I couldn't seem to doze off again. My mind kept racing. In fact, I think it was the only thing keeping me awake."
"Did anything else happen during that day? Anything unusual or out-of-the ordinary?"
"No, nothing really special happened. I worked all morning and afternoon, and I came home to an empty house, no surprise. I made dinner, ate, watched TV, that sort of thing. I didn't feel like doing much more than watching a movie after that, but I couldn't settle down to watch any film, so I ended up reading. I read for a while, but I just wasn't sleepy anymore, so I turned the light out and went to bed. That's when I felt the presence. I mean, I knew something was there, but I didn't realize what it was right away. I tried to ignore it, but I couldn't; I became aware that I was being observed. I was scared, but I also wanted to see who it

My name is Mina Harker."
He nods slowly, and then looks back up at me, "And why are you here?"
This question catches me off guard, because I don't know what to say. It feels strange to answer this question, but I guess I have to tell him something. "Because... I think there might be something wrong with me."
Dr. Szozas gives another slow nod, "Can you explain what you mean by 'wrong'? What do you feel? How does it manifest itself?"
There's a pause while I try to gather my thoughts, and I realize that I've never really thought about this before. Now I'm thinking about it, though, it's starting to seem less frightening than I had originally imagined. "Well, I just..." I start to speak, but I can't find the words. This is the moment where I should be able to put all of my feelings into words, but I'm having trouble getting them out. Maybe I'll just describe the feeling instead.
"It feels like a dark cloud is hanging over my head. And sometimes I get scared. Like, really scared, not knowing what's happening or what will happen next. But other times I feel good. I feel happy and excited, and I want to go outside and play, even if I am sick with a cold."
Dr. Szozas smiles at me, "That sounds very normal, Mina. I would expect those kinds of feelings to be present. You are a healthy young woman, after all."
"Oh, I hope so!"
"What makes you believe that you are sick?"
Now I'm caught again, unsure of how to proceed. "Um, well, I have these dreams at night that are always the same: I am walking through a forest with trees growing around me, but I cannot see the ground beneath me. I am afraid to look down at the ground,

My name is Jennifer Parker."
He nods, "And why have you sought counsel?"
"Well..." I begin, feeling more relaxed now than I did before entering this room. I feel safe here, secure. Like there's nothing bad that can happen to me here, and that makes me feel better. The airy, quiet space helps too. It feels good just being here. But I still don't know what happened to me, or how I got here. "It's hard to explain... but I think something might have gone wrong with my brain, because I've been seeing things recently, and hearing voices. And I've had trouble sleeping lately. I even dreamt about killing myself last night. I was going to jump off the roof of our apartment building, but then I woke up, and realized I was dreaming. When I saw the blood all over my hands, I freaked out and ran away."
Dr. Szozas smiles at me kindly, "So tell me about your dreams."
"Oh God..." I say softly, remembering them clearly now. In my dreams I'm always running away, trying to escape whatever is chasing me. Sometimes it's a monster or animal, sometimes it's a group of people that I recognize from school. They chase after me, and I run until I get tired enough to stop, but they keep coming after me. I wake up screaming.
"What happens when you try to stop?"
"Nothing. I never do manage to stop. I start running again. I remember once I tried to hide under a table, and I couldn't move at all. I thought I was paralyzed, but I was actually dead asleep. I was having a nightmare, but I was awake at the same time. I was really scared!"
"Do any other parts of your body hurt? Do you experience pain anywhere else when you are experiencing these dreams?"
"No, I guess not. I haven't

My name is Amy Smith, and..." My mouth goes dry, and I have trouble speaking.
He nods, "Yes?"
"And... I think something bad is happening to me."
He leans forward, intently watching me, "How do you know this? Can you describe any symptoms?"
"Well, I can feel things inside me... feelings, emotions... It feels really intense sometimes, like there's too much stuff going through me all at once. And other times I get overwhelmed by fear or anxiety."
He sits back, nodding again, "Anything else?"
I swallow hard, "It just started yesterday, and then today it got worse."
Dr. Szozas listens attentively, and asks questions, "Do you remember anything before this happened?"
"No, nothing... except maybe a dream or two. But they were weird, because I wasn't asleep when I had them."
"Were they nightmares?"
I nod slowly, "Yeah, I guess so. They felt real, but I don't remember what was scary about them."
"Are you having problems sleeping?"
I shake my head, "Not really. I sleep fine most nights, but lately I've been waking up early, unable to go back to sleep after that."
"Have you ever experienced a panic attack before?"
I frown, trying to recall, "A couple, yeah. I don't remember the details though, I just knew that it would pass if I did something to calm myself down, like breathe deeply. I'm not sure if that counts as a panic attack, but it felt similar, I guess."
"Does that happen often?"
"Sometimes, but only when I'm anxious about something. I'm usually able to handle it pretty well."
"You said that the dreams are becoming more frequent now, and that the intensity is increasing. Are the dreams getting weirder, or are the feelings stronger and
