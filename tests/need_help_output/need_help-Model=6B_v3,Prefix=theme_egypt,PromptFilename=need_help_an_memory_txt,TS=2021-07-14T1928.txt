=== Prompt ========================================
I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.

[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "


=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Adrianna Dillard."   Oh boy, this is awkward...   It feels strange to talk about myself, especially since I don't know exactly what is happening to me. It also makes me feel vulnerable, which isn't something I do very often. But I have to tell somebody.
"Adrianna?" he asks.  Oh God, now I've said her name twice! What if he knows? And what if she doesn't want anyone else knowing that I exist?! Oh shit, I can hear the blood rushing through my head.
"Yes," I reply, not wanting to say anything more than necessary. I watch the doctor, hoping for reassurance that he won't ask any further questions, but instead he continues, "So, Adrianna, let's get right to it. Tell me a little bit about your situation. Why did you decide to seek counseling?"
I take a deep breath, and begin, "Well, I was reading online, and I came across a psychiatrist named Michael Szozas. I looked up his website, and saw all the things that he had done for people, and I thought I might be able to help. I was wondering if I would need to pay for the consultation, and I was a little worried. I was thinking, 'Would I even qualify?' I was nervous, and I didn't really know if I was ready for this."
Dr. Szozas nods and responds, "That is understandable. The fee is $250.00. Do you have a credit or debit card? Please provide the number and I'll bill the card. We will set up a payment plan for the consultation if you prefer. You may call the office to confirm and discuss details. I'm sure we can work out a way to help you. I hope to be of service to you, Adrianna. I'd like to think I am a good listener, and I'm

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Nesreen Aqil, and I'm here because I think there might be something wrong with me." 
He smiles again, this time I can feel it right through our hands, "Nesreen, tell me about what happened to you?"
I begin telling him all about the past week, starting with the party where we met, and then moving forward. As I talk, I realize that I am able to describe things very clearly and logically, even though they seem completely alien to me. When I finish, Dr. Szozas nods thoughtfully, and then asks, "Are you still experiencing any of those feelings? The ones that caused you distress?"
"Well, not exactly. They were only minor issues, but I do feel a little strange sometimes, especially when I eat certain foods, or when I drink coffee.   But I don't know if I should call them 'feelings.'"
Dr. Szozas leans back in his chair, resting his arms on the padded top, "What would happen if you did have a strong feeling, or a desire, or a craving for a particular food or beverage, or for sex?"
I pause for a moment, and I consider, "I guess I'd try to satisfy the urge, and I'd probably be okay if I just didn't think too hard about it. I wouldn't really want to hurt anyone, or myself. I guess I'm trying to figure out if I'm having a mental breakdown, or if I'm a different person, and I'm getting used to the new me!"
Dr. Szozas chuckles a bit, "I don't believe for a minute that you are a different person, Nesreen, I think you've been living a life that is foreign to you, and I suspect, maybe, you're afraid to accept the fact that you aren't the same as you were before.   I understand how you

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Emma Smith, and I'm here because I want help."
He smiles again, and leans forward in his chair, resting his elbows on his knees, and hands clasped together, "That's great! What do you think would help?"
I pause, trying to find the right words, "Well, I've been having trouble sleeping lately, and I don't know what's causing it. It feels like there's something wrong inside me, but I can't put my finger on it.  I feel restless and anxious, and I have trouble concentrating. When I try to sleep, I just toss and turn, and then when I wake up the next morning, I'm exhausted. The worst part is that it doesn't go away after a few hours. My mind keeps racing, and I keep thinking about all kinds of things, and I start worrying about silly stuff, and I get frustrated when I can't figure out the problem. I don't understand this feeling, and I'm worried about myself."
Dr. Szozas listens patiently, nodding his head occasionally, "Do you drink alcohol or use other drugs? Do you smoke or chew tobacco or marijuana?"
I shake my head, "No, I don't. I haven't smoked in years, and I quit using alcohol a long time ago. I don't even really enjoy the taste, and I hate the smell of cigarettes. I did used to eat a lot of junk food, though, and I'd snack on candy bars and chips, and I ate a ton of ice cream. I was an overweight child, and I still am now, I guess. I didn't realize the damage I was doing to my body until I was in my mid-twenties. I had a bad diet and a sedentary lifestyle, and my weight ballooned out to more than 200 pounds. I tried to lose the weight, I worked hard at it, and I exercised. I joined

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Elaina, I'm 26 years old, single, and I live alone."
He nods, and continues to stare at me, waiting patiently for more information. I feel uncomfortable under his gaze, and I fidget slightly. It doesn't help that my legs are crossed beneath me. I can only imagine what he sees when he looks at them. My thighs are bare, smooth, toned, and strong. They've been waxed recently too, I think they look great.
Finally, I say, "So? What do you want to know?"
Dr. Szozas smiles again, and this time there is a hint of humor in his smile, but not condescension.   "Why don't we start by getting to know each other better? Tell me something about yourself that most people wouldn't know."
I gulp, and I begin, "Well, I have a job working in a coffee shop, and I go out dancing at night sometimes, and I work out at the gym regularly. I also run a lot, and I swim. I play the flute, I sing in the choir at church, and I used to play soccer when I was younger. I even played competitive tennis for a while, until I broke my wrist. I like to read, I watch movies, I listen to music, I cook, I garden, I sew, and I knit. I like to paint and draw, and I enjoy writing poetry and short stories. I like to travel, and I'm a fan of the outdoors. I just moved to town a couple months ago, and I was really excited to find a place that had a pool. I like to hike, and I like to camp, and I like the beach, and I like to fish. I am a big animal lover, I like to pet dogs and cats, I like to ride horses, and I like to get tattoos. I'm an atheist, and

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Samantha Smith, and I've been seeing a therapist named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having." I pause, and then add, "It's really hard to talk about this stuff without sounding stupid, but... I don't know what else to do..."
He nods, encouragingly, and asks, "What sort of issues are we talking about?"
"Well, I guess I have two main ones right now," I begin hesitantly, "One is that I keep fantasizing about a guy named Thomas.   And the other one is that I can't seem to get a date for Valentine's Day." I shrug, and continue. "I'm just not sure if either one is normal or not."
Dr. Szozas smiles, and leans back in his chair. "How long have you had those problems, Samantha?"
I think for a moment, and I say, "A while, maybe six months? I was doing pretty well until I started reading online dating sites. I'd always thought that I was a good person, and I didn't want to let anyone down, and I kept trying to find the perfect match. But I never found the right one, and I was starting to wonder, was I a bad person for being unable to find a relationship?"
I stop, and wait for his reply, and I hear a gentle, reassuring voice, "No, no, I understand. It sounds like you were struggling for a while, and I'm sorry for the trouble. You said that you tried to meet people through an online site, did you try OkCupid, Match.com, Tinder, Bumble, Grindr, Scruff, ChristianMingle, etc.?
I nod my head, and I say, "Yeah, I looked at all of them, and I even went on a few dates, but I was only able to go on three dates, and none

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Rebecca Anne Smith, I have been seeing this wonderful doctor named Dr. Michael Szozas about something that is troubling me."
He nods, "OK, tell me more."
So I continue, "Well, I've never felt better than when I met Dr. Szozas. He listens attentively, asks questions that really get to the heart of the matter, and gives advice that makes sense. When we talk, I feel like I can share anything with him, and I know that whatever he tells me will be completely confidential. He is a good listener, and a very wise counselor.   I want to thank you for taking the time to listen to me. I really appreciate all that you do for people, and I hope that there is a way that I might show my gratitude to you sometime. I would love to go out to dinner with you or maybe even just a drink after work. I think I'd enjoy talking to you a lot. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I really like you, and I'm hoping I don't seem too forward by saying so. But I think I should let you know, and I promise I won't ask for any special favors in return. I just wanted to express my appreciation for the help that you give others, and I hope I haven't made a fool of myself. I am a little embarrassed at the thought of asking for a date, but I was wondering if you might consider being my friend. I'm sorry, I'm babbling now, and I'll shut up. Please forgive my rudeness, and I hope to hear from you soon. Thank you again for listening to me, and for helping me. I'll stop rambling now."
Dr. Szozas smiles at me, "I understand, and I accept. I think you are a lovely young lady, and I look forward to getting to know you. I will call you on Monday morning,

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Mary Beth Johnson. My parents gave me the middle name 'Beth', because they said that I was born early. They also said that I was born on Christmas day."
He smiles again, and asks, "Are those things true?"
I nod, and say, "Yes, both of them. But I don't remember much about being born. It was all very quick, and then I woke up in the hospital, and I was there until I was old enough to go home.   I have a brother, Jeffery, and we were raised together by our mother, Barbara."
Dr. Szozas nods, and leans back in his chair, "So tell me, what do you want to talk about? What brings you here today?"
I feel myself blush, and I stammer, "Well, I've been having...issues..."
And I start to cry.
I've never cried in front of anyone before, and I know I shouldn't, but I can't stop. I try to control my tears, but the dam just keeps breaking. I wipe my eyes, and I sniffle, and I blubber, "I'm sorry, I didn't think I would get this emotional!"
He reaches out, and puts a comforting hand on my shoulder, and he tells me softly, "It's alright, let it out. I'll be right here for you. Just give me a minute, and I'll help you through it. Alright, now, I need to ask you a few questions, and I'd like to hear more about your family. You mentioned a brother, and a father, correct?"
I nod, and I explain, "Jeffrey is my older brother. He's in college, and I'm not sure where my dad is. I haven't seen him since I was a baby, and he hasn't had contact with us in years."
I pause for

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Maya."
He smiles, "Maya... may I call you May?"
I nod, and then I say, "Yes, please do."
"Good! Now tell me what brings you to this office today? You said that you wanted to talk about something, but I don't recall any emails or phone calls before now."
I smile, "Well, actually, I found your website online, and I saw that you were a psychiatrist. And I thought 'Hmm, maybe I should try talking to one of those,' and I just sort of felt that I needed to talk to somebody.   It was a spur of the moment decision."
Dr. Szozas nods, "That makes sense. Did you find anything on my site that resonated with you?"
I blush, "Yeah, a lot of things really. I think I've been in therapy for years, and I never really understood why I keep coming back. But I feel better after each session; I can usually get through a whole day without feeling depressed or anxious. It helps me sleep, too. I have a couple friends in the business, and they always say that the sessions are helpful, and I know that I wouldn't be able to function if I didn't go. So I guess I came to the right place, I hope!"
Dr. Szozas chuckles, "I'm happy that I helped you, Maya. Tell me more. How long have you been in therapy, and what brought you there in the first place?"
I sigh, "I went to college, and I graduated with a degree in psychology. I got a job working for a social services agency, and I did a little counseling work, and I tried to help people. That's when I started having trouble sleeping at night, and I would wake up in the morning and be really tired, and I'd start to wonder if I could ever cope with being a

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Emily K., and I came because I have been feeling depressed lately." I admit this without hesitation. I've had bouts of depression before, but never anything severe enough to seek professional help.
Dr. Szozas nods, and then asks, "Tell me about what happened?"
I think back to the last few months. It all started when my best friend broke up with her boyfriend, and she moved away for college. I was devastated, but I thought maybe I would get over it after a while. But the more time passed, the harder it got to talk about her ex-boyfriend. And now we don't even speak anymore.
Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding occasionally as I continue to describe my feelings, "So tell me, Emily, do you feel like you need something?   Maybe a prescription for Prozac or Zoloft or Paxil or Celexa or Lexapro or one of those other antidepressants?   Or perhaps a referral for a therapist?   Do you want to talk to a counselor or a psychologist or a psychiatrist or a social worker or a counselor or a psychotherapist or a life coach or a marriage guidance counselor or a career counsellor or a financial adviser or a spiritual advisor or a psychic or a shaman or a witch or a medium or a fortune-teller or a numerologist or a palmist or a tarot reader or a astrologer or a seer or a clairvoyant or a shamanic healer or a faith healer or a miracle maker or a guru or a prophet or a preacher or a minister or a rabbi or a priest or a pastor or a monk or a nun or a missionary or a holy man or an imam or a mullah or a muezzin or a wazir or a wizard or a warlock or a witchdoctor or a voodoo doctor or a voodoo woman or a shamen, or

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Kelli McAllister, and I came here because I want to know what's wrong with me."
He nods, "And why do you think something might be wrong?"
I pause again, and then say, "Because...   Because I can't seem to get myself together. And it feels like there's this huge hole inside of me, and nothing fills it."
Dr. Szozas leans forward, elbows resting on his knees, hands clasped between them, and he looks directly at me, "Do you have any idea what is causing that feeling? What about it makes you feel unsettled or uncomfortable?"
I shake my head slowly, "No. I don't really understand why it bothers me so much."
"Kellie," he says softly, "you've been through a lot recently, haven't you?"
I nod, but I don't speak.
"Would you mind telling me a little more about what happened, and why you're here today?"
I tell him all about the fire, and the hospital stay, and the surgery, and the recovery period. When I finish, he listens intently, his eyes moving back and forth, and his mouth pursing into a tight line, "So, you were in the hospital for three months, recovering from a gunshot wound. You had a major operation, which involved the removal of a bullet, and a tracheotomy. Do you remember anything before the accident, or after the accident, or during the surgery?"
I smile, "Oh yes. I was at work at the time, but I'd never worked in a restaurant before, and I didn't realize the dangers of working in a kitchen. I was cutting meat, and a knife slipped, and the blade went through my neck. It severed my spinal cord, and the doctors said that I would probably die. But I survived, and I'm still alive, thanks to the people
