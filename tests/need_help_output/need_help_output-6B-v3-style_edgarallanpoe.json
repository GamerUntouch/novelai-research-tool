One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

I guess I shouldn't have been surprised by this question, because he knows all about me already: My father died last year, after suffering a stroke, leaving me alone with nothing but a few thousand dollars and a lot of debts. And now, I've got two choices: Either go back home to LA, or stay here until I can find another job. But there aren't any jobs available, not even minimum wage ones. I can't afford rent on a studio apartment, let alone buy food.\nBut then again, maybe I should be grateful for this opportunity. Maybe I should just accept what I'm offered, and learn something new about myself along the way. After all, I'm still young enough to change things if I want them changed.\nSo I tell him the truth about me, \"Actually, I'm here to get away from L.A., which is getting too big and crowded for me. I wanted to leave the city behind, and start fresh somewhere else, and I thought that since I had some money saved up, I might be able to get a place here without having to work.\"\nDr. Szozas smiles at me, his face brightening up, \"That sounds like a wonderful plan. You'll be very happy here, I promise.\"\nThen he leans forward, and continues to stare at me intently, with his head tilted slightly to one side. I think I know what he wants to ask me next, but I wait patiently, and finally he speaks, \"Emily, I'd like to discuss your relationship with your father. Would that be alright with you?\"\nOh boy!
