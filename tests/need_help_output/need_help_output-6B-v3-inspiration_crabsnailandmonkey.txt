My name is Araragi Senjogahara."
He looks surprised by this, "Really?"
"Yes, really," I nod firmly.
"Well then... And why have you come today? What brings you all the way out to my office?"
I pause again. This isn't easy, but I continue, "Because I want help figuring out what's happening to me."
"And you think coming to me will give you that help?"
"That's right."
Dr. Szozas nods thoughtfully. "So tell me, Miss Senjogahara, do you suffer from any particular phobias or anxieties?"
"No..."
"What sort of hobbies do you enjoy?"
"Hobbies?"
"You know, things you get pleasure out of doing."
"...Um, well, there aren't many hobbies I can say I've got experience with. I don't watch much TV, either."
"Ah, very good. I'll need to ask you a few questions now, Miss Senjogahara. Please answer honestly. Is there anything about our conversation that makes you uncomfortable?"
"About the whole situation with my body?"
Dr. Szozas smiles wryly, "Not specifically, no. Do you find it difficult answering the question honestly?"
"Honestly is the only option I have."
"Very well. The reason I asked if something made you feel uncomfortable was because I was wondering if you had a fear of being naked."
"Naked?"
"A person's bare skin. If you were to strip off your clothes before me, would that be too embarrassing to bear?"
"Umm, I guess not..."
"Would you be able to show me your bare skin?"
"Show you myâĶĢno, I couldn't. I'm embarrassed about my own body, so I wouldn't be able to show you that."

My name is Araragi Senjogahara." It feels strange saying this aloud after having said it only once before. This isn't something I can hide anymore.
"...And?" he prompts.
"Because I have a problemâĶĢyou know? A serious one... I don't know what happened to me..."
"You don't remember anything about last night?"
"No."
"So then, where did you go yesterday evening?"
"To school."
"What time do you get home?"
"About seven o'clock. My mom makes dinner, which I eat, then I study until bedtime."
"Your mother doesn't cook much?"
"She cooks a lot more than she lets on, actually."
"Hmm. What does your father do?"
"He works part-time at the convenience store across the street."
"Sounds like a busy household."
"It is. We always have to work hard just to keep food on the table. That's probably why I've been able to live a relatively normal life without getting involved with any weird stuff."
"That sounds tough."
"Yeah, it really is. But I'd rather not talk about that right now."
"Is there anyone else living at home besides you and your parents?"
"Yes, two younger sisters."
"Ah. So they'll be coming home soon?"
"They should be back by tomorrow morning at the latest."
"Then let's start with them. Your sister, Sayaka, is she still attending high school?"
"Yeah, but I'm not sure if she's still going to the same school or if she moved somewhere else. I haven't seen her since we graduated from middle school together."
"Mm-hmm. And the other girl, Hachikuji, is she a year older than you?"
"Yup, a freshman at our local junior college."

My name is Hachikuji."
He smiles again, "Thank you very much for coming all this way today, Ms. Hachikuji. Please tell me what brought you here?"
That question makes me a little uneasy, because I don't know myself...but I do have a hunch. "You might say that I've been suffering from depression since middle school..."
"Oh? That sounds serious. Would you mind telling me more?"
It's hard to talk about my past self, especially when I feel embarrassed by it. But I try to keep it short and simple: "When I was in third grade, I was bullied relentlessly by another girl named OikuraâĶĢshe was two years older than me. She picked fights with me, she called me names, she tried to get away with things whenever possible, and worst of all, she spread rumors about me that were untrue. And then one day, I was walking home alone after school when she suddenly attacked me from behind with a kitchen knife. It went through my right shoulder blade, nearly severing my spine."
Dr. Szozas listens intently to my story, his face expressionless. "And what happened next?"
"Oikura ran off. I couldn't move. My mother came running back with a neighbor, but they weren't able to save me. I ended up paralyzed, I can't walk anymore, and I've had to rely on others ever since. I haven't gone outside since that incident, I just stay at home and play games. I'm always sad, and I'm never happy. I'm afraid to go to the bathroom, I'm scared to leave the house. I'm constantly depressed. I hate being me. I wish I'd never existed. I want to die. I'm not even sure if I should continue living or not."
"Hm. I'm sorry to hear that. You must be quite a burden

My name is Araragi Senjogahara."
He nods, and then he continues, "And you've been having trouble sleeping?"
"...Yes..."
"Well... That's good news."
"Huh? What do you mean by 'good news?'"
"It means that we can get started right away. This isn't something that will go away just because you ignore it. It may even grow worse if left alone, so please don't think that this won't require any effort on your part."
"Is there anything wrong with my sleep?!"
"Not necessarily. But maybe I should ask you more questions before answering yours. Do you have a history of insomnia?"
"No..."
"You say that you haven't had much experience with sleeplessness, but have you ever experienced short periods where you couldn't wake up in the morning?"
"Yeah... Once or twice."
"In those cases, did you feel exhausted during the day?"
"That was what happened after the incident with HanekawaâĶĢbut that wasn't due to lack of sleep. I woke up in the middle of the night, but I felt fine."
"Did you have dreams?"
"Sometimes I'd dream about being attacked by a monster that looked exactly like a certain girl I knew."
"Aha! And that would happen when you were unable to sleep!"
"When I was awake, yes. When I slept, I didn't remember them."
"So you dreamed about her while you weren't asleep?"
"Maybe I was dreaming about the same thing that I was thinking about when I fell asleep, but I guess not."
"What kind of thoughts are you talking about, specifically?"
"About the fact that I was dating a girl who I thought I loved but who I eventually realized I hated. About the fact that I kept getting closer to the person I hate the most, but I never got to

My name is Araragi." It feels strange speaking aloud this new name. My old one seemed more suited to me than my current one, but I suppose there wasn't any reason to keep using it.
"Araragi...hmmm..." A pause, then he speaks again, slowly, "That sounds very Japanese."
"...?"
He continues, "You don't mind if I call you by that? That's what most people do, after all."
"Oh yeah, sorry about that," I say, somewhat embarrassed.
"No need to apologize. Please continue."
"Well, yes...it's just that I've never really been called by my given name before. I guess it's because everyone calls me SenjogaharaâĶĢor Hanekawa or something along those lines. And I get confused when they tell me not to worry about it."
"Ah, I see now. You're being treated as a member of the opposite sex, aren't you? What an unusual case," he remarks.
"Is that bad?"
"Not necessarily. But I would recommend against it, if possible. In fact, it might be best to avoid doing anything that draws attention to that side of you. Your appearance may be different, but I doubt that your personality is. If you want to hide your identity, I'd advise that you find a way to change your hairstyle, too. Or maybe cut off the hair entirely. No matter how much time passes, the public will always be curious about a girl with short hair. I imagine that you have long, beautiful hair, though, right? I think a haircut wouldn't be a problem at all."
"What about clothes? Should I go shopping somewhere else to buy a new wardrobe?"
"Don't bother with that. I can't give you advice about fashion anyway. I'll leave that to the professionals."
"O-Okay..."
"But I

My name is Hachikuji."
He nods back, "That's fine, go ahead."
"Hachi...kuji?"
"'Kui,' rather than 'chi,'" he corrects me, and then continues, "It means rabbitâĶĢthe word is used both as a nickname for children, and as a derogatory term for rabbits themselves."
Ahh, I get it now. Rabbit? A cute little bunny girl? Well, this makes sense. My parents did tell me once that there were things called bunnies, and they're really cute. They have fluffy white fur, black button noses, and big round ears. The only problem is, I've never seen one before in real life.
"Rabbit-kun, hmm?" I ask, trying to confirm what he said.
Dr. Szozas smiles again, "Yes, that's right."
Huh. It looks like I got it wrong. But still, I'm happy that we can talk about this stuff without having to worry about offending each other or being embarrassed by our different ways of speaking.
"So, Miss Hachikuji," he begins, "you say that you want help figuring out something strange happening inside you, is that correct?"
"Yup!" I answer excitedly.
"Is it because of a disease, injury, or a mental disorder?"
"Nope!"
He gives me a look, but I don't know why.
"Then is it because of a curse?"
"Uh..."
This is a pretty serious question, but I guess I shouldn't be surprised that a psychiatrist would be asking about curses.
"Well, I suppose I should start with the basics," he states, taking off his glasses, and polishing them with a handkerchief that is hanging from his neck. He puts the spectacles away, and sets his hands atop his desk.
"Miss Hachikuji

My name is Araragi."
"Yes? And?"
"And...because I can't tell anyone else about this problem, I came to talk to you..."
He nods, and asks, "Why do you think there is something wrong with you?"
"Um...well..."
"Do you have any symptoms or signs?"
"Well..."
"What does your family say?"
"They don't know anything."
"Have you been seeing a doctor?"
"...No, not yet."
"So you haven't sought professional help for whatever condition you may be suffering from."
"That's right."
"Are you being treated by a psychiatrist or psychologist?"
"Nope."
"Then what makes you think there is something wrong with you?"
"It just feels that way..."
"You seem healthy enough to me. Are you sure you want to keep coming back to me if nothing is really bothering you?"
"Yeah, I guess so..."
"How old are you now?"
"Seventeen."
"Hmm..."
"Can I ask you one more question?"
"Of course. Go ahead."
"Is it true that you used to be a vampire before becoming a human again?"
Dr. Szozas smiles wryly at that, then looks away. "In fact, that was the case."
"Ohhh!"
"But I was already a vampire when I became a human, and I was a very powerful vampire indeed."
"Huh?!"
"To put it bluntly, I was a bloodsucking fiend who fed off humans' life force. I was the most dangerous type of vampire known to man: a True Blood Vampire. I was also a member of the Seven Fools, the group of vampires that were feared and reviled throughout the world. It was a time when I was a king among kings, but I lost all that after I

My name is Araragi Koyomi."
"...And?"
"'Cause I don't want anyone else knowing my real name. It's embarrassing...and scary..."
He nods thoughtfully. "...You've had a tough time, haven't you? Your grades were always good before this year started, though they slipped a little after summer break began. You've been bullied by your classmates since spring, right? That's why you came to me?"
"Yeah...but I didn't know that until just now."
"It wasn't something I needed to tell you, then. But it explains quite a lot. The fact that you have trouble sleeping, that you can't eat properly, that you get headaches even when there isn't any reason to do soâĶĢin other words, that you suffer from depression."
"That doesn't sound very serious..."
"Depression is not a disease, or a disorder, it is simply an emotional state. In order to treat it, we need to understand its root cause, which is usually the result of a specific trigger. If you don't mind telling me what happened last week, I might be able to help you find out what that was."
"Last week...? Well, I went to visit the shrine with Hanekawa again. We were talking about the rumors about her being a transfer student when she suddenly said that she was a second-year middle schooler named Senjogahara HitachiyaâĶĢ"
"Senjogahara Hitachiya? I heard about that girl, too. She transferred into our class, but she was kicked out of the third-years' club because of a disciplinary issue, right?"
"Right. And I was thinking that maybe I should go to the same school as her, but I got the feeling that if I did that, I'd be taken advantage of. So I decided to leave the third-years' club and wait for things

My name is Hachikuji."
He nods, "And?"
"Um... Well..." My heart starts racing again. This isn't easy. The last time I talked to anyone about this was ten years ago, back when I was still living at home, and even then I had trouble talking about it. But now that I've moved away from home, I want to talk about it. I feel like I have to say something. If I don't, there will always be a hole inside of me where the words should go.
So I tell him, "Well, um, I think I may be cursed."
"Cursed? Cursed by whom?"
"'By whoever is after me.'"
Dr. Szozas looks perplexed, "You're being followed?"
"Yes. Someone wants to kill me. They keep trying to get close to me, and they are using their powers to do it. And I can't seem to stop them."
"But that doesn't sound very specific. Do you know who's doing this?"
"No, but... It feels like the same person is following me everywhere I go. Like they are stalking me."
"That does sound more precise," he agrees. "Could you describe the nature of the curse?"
"It's hard to explain, but I'll try. When I was younger, I was a little girl that was abused by my father, and I was a victim of sexual abuse myself. I was also bullied at school because I was different. I was really small, and I was shy. I was ostracized, and I was scared all the time. I was a shut-in. I was never popular with the other kids. I was always alone, and I was afraid that I'd be killed if I went outside. I was a mess. I was a wreck. I didn't fit in anywhere, and I felt worthless.

My name is Hachikuji. The reason I'm here today is because I have been experiencing unusual feelings lately."
"Unusual? Like what?"
"Well..." It feels strange talking to this doctor while seated on a sofa, and I feel awkward, "...like I've been feeling anxious all day long...and also, whenever I go outside, I start thinking about something that happened yesterday."
"Yesterday? What do you mean by 'something'? Something specific, or just generally?"
"...Something specific."
"Ahh, then let's talk about that."

Chapter 2: A Little Bit Of Advice From My Friend Tsubasa Hanekawa
A little before noon, Araragi Koyomi left the houseâĶĢhe was going shopping with his sister Hitagi Senjogahara, which meant he had two bags stuffed with clothing to buy for her. There were many stores in the neighborhood where they could get their clothes, but since she was a girl (she was eighteen), there weren't any places that specialized in girls' fashion. That said, even if there were such shops, they would only stock up on the basics, and wouldn't be able to provide anything really unique or stylish.
That being the case, the two of them decided to head to a place that specialized in women's fashion. As a result, the two arrived at a store that sold accessories, jewelry, and other things that looked good on a woman.
It seemed that the owner of the shop, Ogi Oshino, was a friend of the family, and when the siblings entered, a middle-aged lady came out to greet them. She wore a white blouse with an apron tied around the waist, and a dark blue skirt with a black apron.
Ogi greeted the sisters with a smile, "Welcome to our humble establishment!"
She led the way into the
