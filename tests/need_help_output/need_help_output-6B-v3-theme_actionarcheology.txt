My name is Lara Drake."
He smiles again, "Good girl!" And then he nods, "So tell me, what brings you here?"
I answer, "Well, I've been having trouble sleeping lately. It started after my trip to Peru, where I saw the statue of the Incan Sun God. When I came home, I couldn't sleep more than three hours a night, and I had nightmares almost nightly. I tried taking medication, but nothing seemed to work, until this morning, when I finally got two hours of deep sleep. But now..."
Dr. Szazas cuts me off, "Tell me about the dreams."
And I do. The details aren't important; I just need to get them out somehow. After describing what happened in the dream, I continue, "It was really vivid, the sun god rising up out of the ground, and he was angry. He was yelling at me, telling me that I have to go back there, and find out what went wrong with the machine. That I'll die if I don't return."
Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding occasionally, "That sounds very intense. Do you think that you may be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder? PTSD is a condition that can occur after a person experiences a traumatic event. People often suffer flashbacks or relive the trauma. They also feel a sense of guilt, or shame, or anger, or fear. Have you experienced any of those symptoms?"
I shake my head slowly, "No... not yet. I haven't felt anything except the exhaustion. I'm afraid that I'm going crazy or something. I'm thinking that I should call the police, or a doctor, but I'm scared to death to talk about it."
The psychiatrist's face becomes serious, his voice is gentle when he speaks, "You shouldn't be frightened. You're safe here. I want to help you, but first we

My name is Julie Andrews." And then I wait again while he looks at me quizzically. Finally, he asks, "And why did you choose this name?"
I explain briefly, "I have been having strange dreams since last night. They started after reading your article on dream interpretation."
He nods slowly, "Yes, yes, I've seen the articles online. Tell me what happened yesterday morning."
So I tell him about waking up feeling sick, disoriented, and confused, being unable to recall anything that had transpired during the previous evening, even though I remembered talking to friends via phone calls, texting them, and sending emails.
Then I start telling him about the dreams, which were vivid, frightening, and disturbing. In one, I was flying through the air, falling toward the ground below me, and just before impact, I woke up screaming. I can still remember those screams echoing throughout the room where I was sleeping, and they scared me to death. The next day I felt awful, and couldn't get back to sleep until late afternoon. When I awoke, there was a note by the bedside: "Have a nice nap âĢĵ Michael." My throat tightened when I read that. I wondered if I should call his office to find out if I'd missed an appointment or something.
Dr. Szozas listened intently as I described the nightmares I was experiencing, and the way I thought about the world becoming a place of fear and danger. He asked me questions about the details of the dreams, and I answered them honestly. I told him about the feelings of dread, the sense of urgency that I experienced, the sudden attacks of panic, the need to flee or hide, the memories that I could not access, the inability to speak, the paralysis that I experienced, the fact that I didn't know if I would wake up the following morning.
Dr. Szozas seemed to be processing all the information that I gave him.

My name is Lara Drake."
He nods, and then continues, "You've been experiencing extreme stress lately?"
"Yes."
"Do you think this stress may have something to do with your recent travels? You were gone for three months, right?"
"Well, yes, but..."
"And did anything happen while you were away?"
"No, nothing really happened except that... I had to go off by myself quite often during those weeks, because I got very lonely."
"Lonely?"
"Yeah, I guess I wasn't used to being alone all day long, or maybe I just didn't know how to cope with it. But I was having trouble sleeping at night, and I couldn't keep food down, and I felt sick most of the time. It was awful. And there was also a lot of frustration building up inside of me, too much anger, I suppose. That was probably the worst part, because when I tried to talk about it with people, they would say things like 'Oh honey, don't worry about it,' and they'd pat me on the shoulder, and tell me to cheer up, but I knew I wouldn't be able to sleep until I talked about what was bothering me."
Dr. Szozas smiles at me, "So, I understand that you wanted to find out if I might be able to help you with these problems."
"That's exactly what I want to know. What can you do for me?"
Dr. Szozas stands back up from his chair, "First thing I need to ask is: are you sexually active with anyone else at the moment?"
"What? No!"
"Have you ever experienced any sexual feelings toward another person before now?"
"Uh, no, I haven't. I'm not sure I'm even capable of that kind of feeling. I never thought about sex that way."
"OK, well that's

My name is Lara Drake."
He nods, "And why did you decide to consult with me?"
I stutter, trying to find the right words, "Well...it's hard to explain..."
"Try me," he urges gently.
So I tell him about the dreams, the images, the feelings, the confusion, and then I add, "This isn't normal behavior for me, I don't do this normally."
He smiles at me again, "What do you usually do?"
Now I feel stupid, because I didn't even think about what I would say next. "Oh, um...well, uhm...I guess I go shopping sometimes."
He laughs, "That sounds very interesting, but let's talk about your dreams. What are they telling you? Are they violent? Do they frighten you? Do they leave any lasting impression?"
"No," I reply, "they aren't violent, but they are frightening. They are confusing too. And they have left a strong impression on me. It feels like I've been thrown into a dark abyss without knowing where or when I will land. The images are vivid and real, and yet there is something wrong with them, like a puzzle that is incomplete, that doesn't quite fit together correctly. I can't get a hold of the pieces, but I know that if I could, I'd understand everything that is happening to me."
Dr. Szozas looks at me with an expression that I cannot read, but I'm sure it is a mixture of sympathy and curiosity. He leans forward, and his voice is low and gentle, "You are having trouble understanding the meaning behind the dreams. Is that correct?"
I nod slowly, feeling a little embarrassed about admitting that I'm not always the sharpest tool in the shed.
Dr. Szozas continues, "Lara, I am going to ask you some questions that may seem strange to

My name is Lara Drake, and I'm seeking professional counseling."
He smiles again, this time a little wider, and nods, "OK... now tell me about yourself."
So I do. I explain that I've been having trouble sleeping since last week, and I can't seem to get back to sleep after waking up. When I try to eat anything other than cereal or toast, I feel sick. And sometimes I have nightmares where I wake up screaming, thrashing about until dawn arrives. The doctor listens patiently while I describe my symptoms.
Finally, he asks, "Have you ever had any type of psychiatric treatment before?"
I shake my head 'no.'
"Do you drink alcohol or use drugs? Any prescription medications?"
Again I answer "No."
Dr. Szozas leans forward a bit, and I sense a hint of concern in his voice when he speaks, "Lara, what is it that makes you believe you need help?"
It suddenly occurs to me that I don't know. It's just something inside me telling me that I need help. But if I knew exactly what was wrong with me, maybe I wouldn't be here right now. Maybe I'd already be taking the pills that would cure me.
But I can't say that out loud. So I keep quiet.
After a moment of silence, Dr. Szozas continues, "You said that you were having nightmares. Do they involve anything specific?"
I think hard about the dreams I remember, the ones that are still fresh in my mind, the ones that I'm afraid to recall. I'm not sure that I want to discuss them, but I'm also aware that I'm the only one who knows the truth about those dreams.
Then I realize that I might be able to talk about the dreams without mentioning the details, but I'll never be completely honest about the cause of the problem. So I decide to go ahead and

My name is Lara Drake."
He looks puzzled, "Lara? Why would you choose such an odd last name?"
Now I feel uncomfortable, and I don't know what to say, "Well...it just seemed right somehow..."
He smiles again, "Yes, yes, I can understand that. My wife chose her maiden name, 'Drake,' which means dragon. She thought she was being clever by choosing something related to dragons, and then adding an extra letter to give it more meaning. It worked quite well, until we had children, and I noticed that everyone called them 'drakies.' The kids loved it. We were having dinner one night when our son started laughing uncontrollably, and said, 'Mommy, Daddy, Mommy, Daddy, darkey, darkey!' You have to admit, that's pretty funny."
Dr. Szozas chuckles, "So now we call all three of our boys 'darkeys.'"
We both laugh together, and I relax. He asks, "What brings you to me today?"
I tell him about my encounter with the strange man, and my subsequent visit to his web site, where I found a message from him. I explain that I was a little concerned about my sanity, but also about the fact that I didn't want to let anyone else know about this problem.
Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding occasionally when I speak. I'm nervous about telling him about the dreams I've been having about the woman in the cave. I'm not sure if I should be honest about that part; I think I'm afraid that I'll lose credibility with the psychiatrist.
After a few moments I ask, "Are you familiar with the work of Carl Jung?"
"Oh yes! I read his book, Memories, Dreams, Reflections, when I was younger. I still use his ideas sometimes. I'm impressed that you are interested

My name is Lara Drake."
He nods, "And why are you here?"
I pause again, this time because I can feel myself getting emotional, and I try to keep control of my emotions by taking deep breaths until they subside. My heart rate slows, and I begin to speak slowly, "Well, after reading all those stories online about people having strange experiences and seeing things... I started experiencing them too. And I don't know what's happening to me. But I think I need help."
He leans forward, his face serious, "Do you believe in ghosts? In spirits?"
This question throws me off guard. "Um, yes, I guess. I've never thought much about it before, but now that I'm starting to have these feelings..."
Dr. Szozas looks up at the ceiling, then back at me, "Tell me more about your experience, please."
So I tell him about my dreams, and waking visions, and hearing voices, and feeling sensations that were not mine. "It's been a rollercoaster ride, to say the least. I'm scared; I'm confused. It feels like there are two sides of me, one that is normal, and the other that is crazy. I want to get rid of the crazy side, but I just can't seem to do that."
"Have you ever heard the term synesthesia?" asks the doctor.
I shake my head 'no', although I did hear the word once, when I was younger.
"Synesthesia is a condition where the senses are stimulated at the same point; that is to say, when I taste something bitter, I also perceive sound or color; the tastes are associated with sounds that are perceived simultaneously. For example, I might taste a certain fruit and I associate the flavor with the color red; if I ate the same fruit, I would see the same color."
"Yes, I remember that from school

My name is Lara Jones."
He nods, then asks, "And why did you call?"
I pause again, this time taking a deep breath before responding, "Well, I've been having trouble sleeping lately, and I thought maybe there were something wrong with me. I guess I wanted somebody to tell me what was happening."
Dr. Szozas smiles kindly, "That's perfectly understandable. It's not uncommon for people to have difficulty falling asleep after reading material related to their particular field of study. What do you usually read? Are you interested in history or archaeology?"
I answer honestly, "No, I don't really know much about either one, just bits and pieces, mostly what I find online."
Dr. Szozas chuckles, "You sound like a typical young person today, not knowing anything about history or archaeology, except what they can learn from Wikipedia. Well, let's get started." He pauses briefly, "Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?"
"Not at all," I reply.
"Are you married?"
"Yes."
"Children?"
"One daughter, 18 years old."
"What does she do for a living?"
"She works at a local restaurant."
"How long ago was that?"
"Three months ago."
"Have you had any recent changes in your life, perhaps a relationship that ended badly?"
"Yeah," I say, "my girlfriend left me three weeks ago."
"Why was that a bad change in your life?"
"We'd only dated a month, and I was still getting to know her better. We broke up because we didn't seem to mesh well together. I was hoping that I would meet a woman who was more compatible with me than the last one was."
"Did you feel that was important to you at that point?"
"Yes," I admit.
"When you found out

My name is Lara Croft." And then I pause, thinking. Should I tell him? Is there any reason to hide anything from this guy? No one else knows, except maybe my family, and they don't know where I am. Why would I want to keep something secret from this good doctor? But what do I say next? "Well, I've been having problems... Well..."
He smiles broadly again, "That will be all right, Ms. Croft, just relax. You can start by telling me what happened to you." He leans back in his chair, and crosses his legs, waiting patiently.
So I begin, "It started when I went to college. My roommate had bought a copy of Tomb Raider II, and we played it together, and it got me hooked. I loved the game, but I also found myself becoming obsessed with finding treasure, especially gold coins. It was fun to find them, and even more exciting when I'd use them to buy new equipment. So I began to spend time digging through the ruins, trying to find hidden treasures."
Dr. Szozas nods along with me. "Go ahead, please continue."
"One day I came across an old tomb, but I didn't have enough money to open it. The guards were watching us closely, so I decided that I needed a distraction to get away. I asked the guard if I could borrow his torch to examine the entrance to the tomb. He agreed, but I used the opportunity to slip inside the entrance, and hid the torch behind a rock near the entrance to the tomb. I was able to move the stone, and I discovered a small room filled with chests. I opened the chest with the most valuable item, a golden coin. I took the coin outside, to a spot I knew I wouldn't be disturbed, and I hid the coin. I returned to the tomb, and I couldn't resist opening the other two chests to see

My name is Lara Drake."
He nods, and continues, "And tell me where you live?"
I explain, "I'm staying in New York City at the moment."
"Well then, let's get started, shall we? You said you were experiencing some difficulty...   Tell me what exactly is troubling you."
So I begin telling him all that happened, including my dream experience last night, which seemed to have been a warning sign, but I didn't know it at the time. It took a lot out of me to talk through this whole ordeal. But once I got started, I found myself smiling again. The doctor listened intently, nodding along with my story, asking questions only occasionally, such as when I described the black rock. When I finished, he sat back in his chair, steepled his hands together, and thoughtfully stared at me, before saying, "You mentioned that you've had dreams recently, correct?"
"Yes sir. And I think they may be related to something else I'm trying to figure out," I replied.
"Have you ever experienced anything similar to the one you just recounted?"
"Not really. My most recent dream was different than the others; I saw a woman, she looked older, and I don't remember her face clearly, but I do recall that there was a man with her, who appeared to be a guard. They both wore cloaks. I also heard them talking, but I couldn't understand their words. I woke up, wondering if I'd somehow gone insane. It frightened me quite a bit. I haven't seen or dreamed about the couple since that day, but I can't help but wonder about it. What are the chances that I'll run into that couple again? Do you think it's possible that I'm being stalked by a couple who are following a pattern that I can't even fathom?"
Dr. Szozas considered my question
