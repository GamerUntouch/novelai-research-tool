=== Prompt ========================================
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "

=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Irene Adler." My throat tightens, and tears begin to form in my eyes. I turn away from him, because I can't bear to have this stranger witness the pain and shame I feel right now. I know what they'll say: 'It's just stress.' But I don't want them to tell me that I'm being silly, or hysterical, or making too much of nothing.
After a moment, I regain control of myself, and I face him again. When I do, he asks, "And why did you contact me?"
This time, I answer directly. "Because...because I think I might be losing my mind. And if I am..." I trail off. I wish I hadn't said anything, but there was no stopping it. It all came spilling out of me.
Dr. Szozas looks concerned, "Tell me more about this situation. You were reading through the web, yes? What was it that caught your attention?"
So I explain to him about the strange dreams, the nightmares that come to haunt me when I sleep, the voices that speak inside my head. I describe the feeling of helplessness, and despair, and hopelessness, and the sense of impending doom. I also tell him about the physical symptoms I've been experiencing, the nausea, the headaches, the dizziness, the insomnia, the lack of appetite.
He listens attentively to me, nodding occasionally, asking questions about my background, my life. He tells me that he will need to meet with me several times before we determine whether I'm suffering from any medical conditions or mental disorders. He wants to get a better idea about the severity of the problem, and to find out if I am indeed going insane.
When I finish, he sits silently for a few moments, thinking. "You mentioned that you had trouble sleeping last night. Do you recall anything that happened to cause that difficulty?"
I shake

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Irene Winters."
He nods, then continues, "And why did you contact me?"
"Well..." My mind goes blank. What do I tell this man? How can I explain all of this insanity? The doctor sits forward, leaning slightly towards me, "Tell me what happened to you today."
So I begin telling him everything. When I get to the part where I found myself back at my house after being kidnapped by those men, he looks puzzled, "You were abducted by two strange men...and yet they let you go home without incident?"
"Yes, well, they didn't really kidnap me. They just took me away from school, but they released me before we got there."
"Oh," he replies, "well, that explains things. You say that you have been experiencing unusual sensations since yesterday morning?"
I nod, and continue, "It started out like usual. I had a headache, which went away pretty fast, and I felt tired. But then I heard something weird. It was like a low hum, or maybe a buzz, but I couldn't figure out what it was. And when I tried to think about it more, my head hurt even worse than before. I thought that I should try to rest, but I kept thinking about the noise. Finally, I decided to listen to music to distract me, and I put on one of the songs that I downloaded last night, 'The Blue Danube', but the song wasn't playing right, and the lyrics weren't making sense. I don't know if the song itself was broken, or the player, but I ended up getting frustrated, and I shut off the stereo. That's when I noticed that I was feeling a little dizzy. I sat down to catch my breath, but I realized that I needed to use the restroom. So I stood up to walk to the bathroom, but I stumbled, and fell to the floor.

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Irene Winters." My heart starts pounding wildly, and I feel myself blush slightly. "Um... well, I think there might be something wrong with me..." I say nervously.
He leans forward, elbows resting on his knees, and he asks gently, "And what do you suspect may be wrong?"
This question brings tears to my eyes. It feels good to finally have someone ask this question. Someone besides myself. I don't know if I can trust anyone else right now. But I guess I should start somewhere.
"Well... um... maybe I've been having visions? Or dreams? And they seem real, except sometimes I get confused or scared when I wake up. Sometimes I find things weirdly familiar, yet other times I just want to cry because I remember stuff that happened years ago. I dunno if I'm crazy, or delusional, or if I'm remembering events that really did happen, or even if I'm dreaming them all up."
Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair, and he listens intently to my rambling words. "It sounds to me like you are experiencing an unusual form of post-traumatic stress disorder," he states matter-of-factly.
Oh no! I didn't expect that answer. What does that mean?! Is that bad news? I look at him anxiously, hoping that I wasn't too stupid to understand his explanation.
"You are not alone in that diagnosis, Ms. Winters," he assures me.
That's a relief. I breathe a sigh of relief, then I ask, "What causes that?"
"For many people, the cause is a traumatic event that occurs during childhood. Other common triggers include the loss of a loved one, the death of a family member, the sudden end of a relationship, the abuse of a child by a parent or caregiver, the sexual assault of a child, the witnessing of violence, the threat

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Irene Winters." The moment I say this, I feel myself relax. It feels good to have said those words aloud, because they were mine. They felt right coming from me. "And I want help with... something that's been bothering me since last week. And I don't know what else to do. I've tried reading the web, but I can't figure out what's wrong with me."
He smiles again, and nods, "OK, let's start there. Tell me more about what happened, starting with when you woke up yesterday morning..."
So I tell him about waking up feeling sick, having trouble breathing, being unable to focus, getting dizzy spells, and then losing control of my body, all while I was still asleep. When I finished telling him about the whole ordeal, he looks at me quizzically, "Well, that certainly sounds serious enough to warrant an appointment with a psychiatrist. Can I ask if you took any prescription medication?"
I shake my head emphatically, "No, none at all."
Dr. Szozas sighs, "It's very common to experience sleep paralysis, especially when one is new to the condition. Your brain doesn't quite get used to the fact that you are dreaming, and it tries to wake up the sleeper. But the sleeper is not awake, and the dreamer is paralyzed. That's where the 'paralysis' comes from. Some people find that their dreams are not pleasant, or even frightening. For others, though, the nightmares are much worse than anything the world has to offer. In either case, the only way to deal with them is to confront the nightmare with the intent to conquer it. To face the fear, to overcome it. You'll need to practice that technique with the aid of a therapist or counselor, but I think I might be able to give you some suggestions that will be helpful to you."
"Can I go home now?

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Irene Winters." My heart pounds away inside my chest, and my face flushes hot as I continue, "Irene, uh... I don't know what's happening to me, and I'm scared..."
He nods, and then he sits back and folds his hands across his lap, "So tell me, Irene, what do you remember?"
I swallow hard, "Well, I woke up this morning, and I had to go to work, and I was thinking about all kinds of things -- mostly work stuff -- and when I got there, I couldn't concentrate, and I felt dizzy, and I just wanted to leave, but I didn't want to upset anyone else, so I stayed until lunchtime, but by then I was feeling really bad, I thought I might throw up or something, so I went home early, and I lay down on the bed, but I kept having weird dreams, and I was afraid they were nightmares, because sometimes when I have those, I can't move, and I feel paralyzed, and I keep hearing voices telling me to hurt myself, but then other times I hear them saying 'stop', and that freaks me out even more!"
Dr. Szozas listens attentively to me, nodding along as I speak. He makes notes on a legal pad with a pen that he keeps beside his computer monitor. He looks up at me after a moment, "And did you ever try to harm yourself? Do anything to get rid of the voices?"
I shake my head slowly, "No. I tried to talk to people about the voices, but no one would listen, they told me I wasn't crazy, that I needed to snap out of it, that I should be grateful to be alive, that I shouldn't waste time worrying about silly things, and that I'm lucky to be living a life that I enjoy, that I should be thankful for everything that I've

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Irene Kallos."
He nods, acknowledging my answer, then looks back at me, waiting patiently.
"I've been having trouble sleeping recently. It started after my sister died last year. She had cancer, and she passed away within days of diagnosis. My insomnia became worse after her death. The pain from losing her just wasn't being assuaged by sleep." I pause again, trying to find the right words to express what I'm feeling inside.
Dr. Szozas nods encouragingly.
"And now?" he asks gently.
I feel myself getting teary eyed, and I have to blink them away before continuing. "Now... I can't stop thinking about her. I think about her constantly, all day long. And I don't want to be alone anymore. I need help."
Dr. Szozas studies me carefully for a few seconds, then smiles broadly. "That sounds like a very complicated case to diagnose, let alone treat. But I'll do my best. What are your symptoms? Are they physical or psychological?"
"Both," I reply honestly. "It feels like there are two people living in me: one that wants to be with my husband, and another that thinks about my sister. I'm afraid to go to bed because I know that if I wake up in the morning, I will remember something awful happened the night before, but if I stay up too late, I won't be able to get up the next morning."
Dr. Szozas chuckles. "Sounds like a classic double bind to me. So tell me more about this 'other person'."
"She's a ghost," I say softly.
"A ghost?" He raises an eyebrow.
"Yes, a ghost. I'm not sure if I'm crazy or I'm imagining things. I just know that I am haunted."
"Haunted how?"
"By a phantom that I

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Irene Adler."
He nods, slowly, "Yes...yes..."
And then I continue: "I have been reading through all kinds of strange things online, trying to understand myself better. And after seeing some videos of people talking about their experiences, I decided to email this particular doctor. But now I don't know what else to do."
Dr. Szozas leans back, crossing one leg over another, and resting his hands atop them. He smiles again, reassuringly. "Well, let's start by getting to know each other. Tell me about yourself?"
So I tell him about my life. My family history, where I live, work, and go to school. About my hobbies. What makes me happy. Why I enjoy working in libraries. All sorts of mundane information, but it feels good to get it out there. It helps me relax, too.
After I finish telling him about myself, he asks, "What made you decide to seek help? Was it something specific?"
I shake my head, "No, nothing really special. Just sort of an epiphany."
Dr. Szozas laughs, "An 'epiphany,' hmm?"
"Yeah, I guess that's the best way to put it. I just realized that I was unhappy, and I didn't know why. I was having trouble sleeping, I was anxious, I was angry a lot of the time, but I couldn't pinpoint exactly what was making me feel that way. I was miserable, and I knew that I needed to change something, but I wasn't sure what that was. I felt lost and confused about my feelings, and I was afraid that I might lose control. I had no idea how to deal with these emotions or the problems I was facing, and I was starting to think that I was going crazy. So I came to the library to find out more about myself, and I started looking through

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Irene Winters."
He nods, then looks back at me, waiting patiently.
"Well, this isn't really normal behavior for me..." I start to explain, feeling embarrassed by the admission.
"It can be hard to admit something is abnormal," he replies kindly.
"That makes sense," I agree.
"Do you know what a 'sensory overload' is?" he asks, and I shake my head.
"You've been experiencing sensory overload? That sounds... terrible." He offers sympathetically.
"Yes, yes it does," I nod sadly, "it feels like there's too much input coming through all my senses, and they just aren't processing it properly anymore."
"Hmm, I see. How long have you felt this way?"
"Since last week," I reply.
"How did you discover this condition?"
"Last Wednesday, after I went online to research the symptoms of schizophrenia, I found an article about sensory overload, which explained that people experience a similar phenomenon when their brains are overloaded with information. It was only then that I realized the connection between my problem and a possible cause: excessive internet use," I tell him.
"And you believe that is the source of your problems?"
"Yes, I do," I say firmly.
"Why do you think that is the case?"
"Because I used to be a very heavy user of the web before I started having these issues," I answer honestly.
"Interesting theory," he responds thoughtfully. "So let me ask you this; are you aware that the Internet is a vast repository of knowledge?"
"Of course I am!" I exclaim, "but I don't feel that I'm using it correctly!"
"But you are," he counters, "you are accessing the data that is available to you. The question is, how are you choosing to process the information that is being

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Irene Winters." My mind races, trying to think of what else to say next, and then I realize I have nothing more to add. That's all there is to tell, isn't it? I don't know what happened after I left home. All I remember is waking up naked in this room, confused and disoriented. There are other memories too, but they aren't important right now. What matters is that I need help, and I need it fast.
"What do you want to talk about?" Dr. Szozas asks gently, encouragingly. He doesn't rush me, or try to force anything onto me, just calmly waiting for me to decide whether I should continue. I feel myself relax, and begin to open up to him.
I start by telling him about my parents, which is easy enough since we've already established that I live alone. It wasn't until I was sixteen that I learned about their death. They were killed in a car accident when I was fourteen, and the police never found out who did it, though they suspect that my father had an affair with another woman. I didn't learn any details about her, but she apparently got pregnant and the baby died in childbirth. I also learned that my mother had been having affairs before that one, and that I might not be the only child that resulted from those relationships. I was angry at them for cheating on each other with others, but I still loved them dearly; I knew that if I'd known about the first pregnancy I would not have let them go through with the abortion.
Dr. Szozas listens intently to everything I said, nodding occasionally as I spoke. I can't really describe the feeling I get from talking to him; I'm used to being the center of attention, but I feel at ease with Dr. Szozas listening to me without interrupting. I feel like I'm opening up to him, I trust

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Irene Winters." The words just spill out of me without any thought, I feel such relief, and joy, to finally tell this stranger my real identity, "and I'm here because...well, I can't explain exactly what's wrong with me, but something's really off. It feels like there's a giant hole inside of me, and all kinds of things are falling through it..." My voice trails off, and I begin to cry. This isn't supposed to happen, I shouldn't have been crying, but I do, sobbing uncontrollably, tears streaming down my cheeks, "It's awful, I don't know what to do!" I wail, shaking and trembling.
Dr. Szozas sits forward in his chair, placing his hands gently on mine, "Oh dear, let me get you a tissue, hmm?"
He stands up, goes to the bookcase behind his desk, pulls out a box of tissues, and returns with them to me. He places one on the table next to me, and another in my hand. I wipe away the tears with the tissue, trying to compose myself.
"Now, now, Irene, please calm down, we'll talk about this. Please try to relax, and breathe deeply, and focus on the sound of my voice. You are safe, I promise you that, I won't hurt you, or judge you, or criticize you. I will listen, I will help, I am not a psychologist, but I am a doctor, I am a professional counselor, and I am willing to give you the best advice that I am capable of giving, okay? I'm not a miracle worker, I'm just a regular person, but I'm not a bad guy, either. So, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I want you to answer me truthfully. If I think that I need to call a colleague or the police
