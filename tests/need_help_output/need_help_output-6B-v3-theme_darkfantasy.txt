My name is Lilliana Elisabeth Sorensen." The last part sounds strange coming out of my mouth. It doesn't feel right saying that name. I just can't get used to calling myself by my given name, even though I've been doing so since I was born. And then there's this weird feeling inside me, something deep within me that feels wrong, and I don't know what it is. I have never felt anything like this before. My parents had always called me Liz, which wasn't too bad, but now I want them to call me Lil instead.
He listens intently to my explanation, nodding along with me. When I finish talking, he sits back in his chair and looks at me with a serious expression. "Liz, do you remember any of your childhood?"
I think hard, trying to recall those days spent with my mother, father, brother, sister...no, nothing really stands out. But I'm sure they were good times, because we did things together all the time. We went to parks and swimming pools, to the beach, and sometimes to museums or concerts. They loved music, and I was raised listening to classical piano pieces with my mother playing, and she taught me how to play the violin when I turned eight years old.
But I don't remember much about school, except for maybe a couple classes. I seem to remember a few teachers, but I can't quite place their faces. I also vaguely remember being bullied at one point; I think that I may have gotten into a fight with a boy named Nathan. I don't know if I hurt him, but I definitely didn't care about getting into trouble with the authorities. I was only a kid, after all.
Dr. Szozas is watching me carefully, and I try to tell him about that incident with Nathan. I describe the event, and the aftermath. I describe how I got into trouble with the police

My name is Alyssa."
He smiles, and asks, "And why did you want to see me?"
I pause again, "Well..." I stutter, "I don't know really...it just seemed important to me that I talk to somebody about this."
"Is there anything else you'd like to tell me? Anything at all that might help us get started?"
I think back to what happened yesterday. I try to remember any details that may have been helpful, but nothing comes to mind. It was pretty much just a blur. What was I doing? How had I gotten home? Did I do something stupid or dangerous?
"No, not really. Just that I feel weird, and I need help figuring out what's wrong with me. That's all," I say.
Dr. Szozas nods, "OK then, let's start by talking about what led up to the incident."
So I explain to him about waking up that morning feeling sick and dizzy, and having trouble walking normally. My legs felt heavy, and I couldn't stand upright without swaying a little bit, even though my balance was fine when standing still. I tried to walk across the room, but I lost control, stumbled, fell forward, hitting the wall. I got up, walked into the kitchen, grabbed a glass of water from the fridge, and drank it. The next thing I knew I woke up in bed. I thought about calling the doctor, but decided against it. I'm sure that I would've just ended up at the hospital anyway.
"Did you drink alcohol last night?"
"Yes, I had a couple drinks with friends at a bar," I reply.
"Were they strong drinks? Beer, wine, hard liquor?"
"Wine. I only had a few sips, but I didn't feel drunk. I wasn't that buzzed, but I definitely had a good time.

My name is Eliza." My heart races nervously within my chest, "And I came because..." I trail off, feeling awkward, and then I ask, "Are we just going to talk? Or do you have any questions?"č
He smiles again, "Well, let's start by talking about you. What brings you here today?"č
I feel even more uncomfortable now, "Um...well, uh...it's kinda embarrassing actually..."
Dr. Szozas holds up one finger, indicating that I should wait until I've finished speaking before moving onto anything else, "Yes?"
I exhale deeply, "OK, well...my girlfriend and I broke up last week, and she was really upset about it, and we were having this argument all day yesterday, and um..." I pause, "It got pretty bad, and I don't know what to do. She won't talk to me anymore, and I'm not sure if I can trust her anymore or if she'll ever forgive me. And I want to apologize to her, but I don't know how."
Dr. Szozas nods slowly, "That sounds very much like an anxiety disorder. Let me try something out." He reaches into a drawer, pulls out a small notebook, flips through pages, and finds a blank page. He scribbles something down, looks up at me with a smile, and asks, "Do you mind if I jot a few notes while I think about this?"
I shrug, "Go ahead."
He writes furiously, occasionally glancing up to look at me, then resumes writing. He glances up at me, his face serious, and I find myself wondering whether I look that way when I'm nervous.
After a minute, he closes the book, and places it back into the drawer, "So, I understand that the two of you had been dating since high school. Is that correct?"
I nod, "Yeah

My name is Jane." And then I pause again, unsure where this will go next. My heart beats faster as I speak, "I think there may have been something wrong with me, because I've had a few odd experiences recently. Some very strange things happened, and..."
He interrupts me before I can finish speaking, "You know, I'm really sorry to hear about what's been happening to you lately, Jane. You seem to be dealing with quite a lot right now. It would probably help if we were able to get a better understanding of exactly what's been going on, wouldn't it?"
So I tell him all about it, about the dreams and the nightmares, the voices, and the loss of control. When I'm done talking, he nods slowly, his expression serious. "That does sound pretty unusual. But let's start at the beginning. Tell me about your life prior to the events that led up to this current predicament."
We talk for a while about my past, including my childhood. I mention growing up in rural Ohio, living with my parents and older sister until I went away to college. After graduation, I moved back home and got married, but I divorced after two years. Now I live alone. I don't date much, and I don't do drugs or drink too heavily. I work part time at the local library, helping kids find books they might enjoy.
As I'm describing these mundane details, I realize that I'm not being completely honest with Dr. Szozas about my life. I feel guilty about that, but I'm not sure how to explain myself. I'm just not used to having people in my personal space. I'm still getting accustomed to the idea that I can trust someone.
But Dr. Szozas is so friendly, and his manner is so open and non-judgmental that I begin to relax. I tell him about the recent changes that I've gone through

My name is Deryah." My voice quavers slightly, which surprises me. It sounds so strange coming out of my mouth, almost robotic. "And I want to know what happened to me?"
He nods, and then he leans forward, and asks gently, "What do you remember before waking up in this room? Any dreams, any feelings or sensations?"
Oh god, now we get to the meat of it all. This is where I have to tell them about...everything. And I feel myself starting to tremble again. But I try to focus on what he is asking me, and I begin to recount my dreamlike memories: feeling cold, being alone, hearing voices, seeing things, falling through darkness...then there was light. A white room, a bed, a doctor, a nurse, a needle...and nothing after that. I can only hope they will believe me when I say I don't really recall anything else.
Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding occasionally as I talk. He doesn't interrupt or ask questions, just sits quietly, listening to me describe my experience. I'm surprised at the lack of judgement that comes across when he asks "So you've been having nightmares ever since waking up, is that correct?"
I nod, "Yes."
"Do you think that you might be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder?"
I shake my head, "No, I don't think that's the case..."
"Why not?"
"...because I don't think I was traumatized by anything specific. I was dreaming about a lot of different things. Some were pretty scary, but most weren't. I was afraid that I was losing my mind, but I wasn't actually scared that I was going crazy. I was just worried that I was becoming unhinged."
He nods, "It's hard to put into words, but I understand that much. Do you know if anyone close

My name is Tashana."
He nods, "And why did you decide to seek professional help?" he asks, almost casually.
I pause again, and then respond hesitantly, "Well... I think I may have lost control of myself recently. It started after I had sex with another woman, which caused me great shame and embarrassment. But more than that, I feel like something happened to me while we were having sex. Like I just sort of snapped back to reality afterwards, and I don't know what happened. All I can say is that I felt very strange afterward." I tell him this all without stopping to breathe.
Dr. Szozas listens intently to my story, and he lets me talk through it until I've finished. "You said you had sex with her? How many times exactly?" he inquires.
"Twice. Once before the night club, and once right afterwards. The second time was even worse than the first one because she wanted me to keep doing things to her. She kept asking if I would fuck her harder, or do other stuff to her. I tried to stop her, but I couldn't help it. My body wouldn't listen to me anymore." I recount my experience with the blonde girl, the way that I let go of the leash I held onto earlier, the way that I just gave into the animalistic urges that I'd been trying to suppress.
After I finish talking, Dr. Szozas sits there silently for a long moment, his face devoid of emotion. He looks at me with his head cocked to the side, his mouth slightly open, "Tasha, I'm going to ask you to please stand up now," he instructs me.
I rise up from the couch, and I move towards the door. "I'm sorry, but I need to leave. I'll come back next week for a follow up appointment," I inform him.

My name is Tasha Marie Riggs." I pause, wondering if this will work, then continue, "And...well, I think I have a problem..." My words trail off. What do I say next? How can I explain all this without sounding insane? This isn't something I want people to know about, but what choice does I really have? If I don't tell anyone, they'll keep asking questions until I give them answers, which I'm not ready to do yet.
He nods slowly, patiently waiting for me to finish speaking before responding. "Why did you decide to seek help?"
This is where things get tricky. I feel myself growing defensive, and I start to reply back defensively, "Well, because I've been having trouble sleeping lately, and I'm not sure if it's just stress or what." I glance up at him briefly, trying to gauge his reaction. He doesn't seem surprised by anything I said, but he looks concerned.
"Have you tried medication?" he asks gently, "You mentioned insomnia earlier, but perhaps there are other symptoms that might indicate depression, anxiety, substance abuse, psychosis, etc."
Oh god, I hope he doesn't ask me about any of those things! I try to play it cool, but I'm sweating bullets inside. I manage to squeak out a simple "No, I haven't tried medication", but I'm pretty sure that I'm lying. I'm worried that I'm going to be asked to leave soon. I need more time! I'm not ready to talk about these issues with anyone else.
Dr. Szozas listens to my responses carefully, nodding to himself occasionally. When I'm done, he leans forward, his hands resting on his knees, "Are you familiar with the term 'unusual case'?"
I nod nervously, I'm afraid to speak again.
"Do you agree that your situation is unusual?"
I sigh inwardly

My name is Kaitlyn."
He nods, "And why do you think this doctor should examine you?"
I pause again, and then answer, "Because... because I feel weird sometimes. My mind goes blank, and I can't concentrate. And other times I just get angry really fast without any reason. It makes me want to hurt people or things. Sometimes I don't even know what I'm doing."
Dr. Szozas smiles sympathetically, "That sounds very much like a classic case of Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), or Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD). Have you ever heard those terms before? If not, they're both disorders where there are multiple distinct personalities within one person. The two most common types are:
1) Dissociation âĢĵ When parts of the personality split off from the main body, usually due to trauma, stress, abuse or neglect. These separate entities often have their own memories, thoughts, feelings and behaviors. They may also experience amnesia, which means they don't remember anything about themselves prior to splitting away.
2) Implantation Ã¢ÅłÄĽ This type is more rare than dissociation, but involves having a different part of the brain control another part of the body. For example, if a woman were to lose her ability to speak, she might develop a new persona that would talk instead. Or if a man lost his sight, he might create a character that was blind, and use that to navigate the world.
What we've got here is a combination of these two conditions. You seem to be experiencing a lot of mental anguish right now, but I'm guessing that it's all been internalized rather than externalized. What I'm getting at is that when something is happening internally, you won't be able to recognize it unless you look at the outside effects.
For instance, if I asked you to write a sentence using only the letters A-E,

My name is Celia Beaumont."
He nods thoughtfully, "And why do you think you should come see me?"
I pause again, "Well... I don't know..."
"Do you have any history of mental illness? Any previous suicide attempts? Do you feel suicidal now?"
Oh crap! This guy is good. It feels like he knows all of this already, like he's reading off a script or something. What does he want from me? I can tell by his expression that he wants me to continue, so I try to answer honestly, "No, none of those things. But I've been feeling really weird lately. Like there are people watching me constantly. And they aren't happy with what I'm doing. They just keep trying to stop me."
Dr. Szozas looks perplexed, "You say 'people,' plural? Who exactly are we talking about?"
"Just one person right now. A woman named Adeline. She keeps showing up everywhere I go, and she tries to talk to me. But whenever I get close to her, she disappears."
Dr. Szozas pauses, "What makes you believe that the woman is an actual being rather than simply a figment of your imagination?"
"It doesn't matter if she's real or not. I just need help. Please, can I ask you questions about my condition or whatever it is that I'm experiencing?"
He smiles, and shakes his head, "I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy a challenge, but I'm afraid that I'm not the best qualified to help you with this particular issue. I would suggest that you seek out the services of a psychiatrist, perhaps a specialist in dissociative disorders or schizophrenia. If I were treating you, I might be able to give you a referral to a professional who is more familiar with your case. I'm sorry I couldn't be of more assistance."

My name is Astrid McBride." I pause there, waiting for him to ask more questions, but he just nods silently, waiting for me to continue. I feel awkward being in this position, but I have to do it. I try to speak clearly, slowly, trying to find words that will express what I want to say, "When I came home last night, I was..." I swallow hard, "...different." My heart races, and I can hear myself breathing faster than normal, I know that I sound strange, but I don't care. I need to get this off my chest.
Dr. Szozas doesn't interrupt me, but instead watches me intently, nodding occasionally, "Yes?"
"Last night... I didn't recognize anything that was happening to me. It felt like I was watching TV, except I wasn't really watching it. It was all very hazy, and I couldn't tell if I was awake or asleep. And then something happened, and I woke up in bed next to my husband." I catch my breath, and slow down, "And I remember seeing the two of us together, and thinking that we were making love."
He looks at me thoughtfully, and his lips press into a thin line. He leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees, his hands clasped loosely between them. His face is serious, but not stern. His eyes are still fixed upon mine. I wonder if I should go on, but I think I've said enough, I haven't revealed much yet.
But Dr. Szozas speaks first, his voice calm and even, "Astrid, I'm going to give you a few minutes to compose yourself. I'll be right outside the door, please call me when you are ready to proceed with the interview."
The door closes behind him, leaving me alone with the psychiatrist. I am a bit surprised that he would leave me alone with a
