Apparently he specializes in unusual cases.

I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

What do you remember?\"\n\"Well, I woke up early this morning, and got ready for work, and went off to bed after I ate breakfast.\"\n\"Anything unusual happen during dinner? Or before bedtime?\"\n\"No, nothing really special happened. The usual stuff: TV shows, movies, phone calls, emails, etcetera. Nothing out of the ordinary.\"\nDr. Szozas leans forward slightly, resting his elbows on his knees, \"You had any alcohol or drugs tonight?\"\n\"No, not that I recall. Why would I drink if I wasn't already drunk?\"\n\"Very astute observation. So what was different about this evening compared to other evenings?\"\n\"Nothing. It was just another day at work.\"\n\"But you said you were tired when you went to sleep?\"\n\"Yeah, that's right. My boss gave me an assignment to finish up by 5pm, and I knew that I wouldn't be able to complete it by that time.\"\n\"So you decided to go to bed early?\"\n\"Yes, that sounds correct. But that's not all, Dr. Szozas. When I looked at the clock, it was only 6am -- that can't be possible!\"\n\"It most certainly is. You slept through the entire afternoon.\"\n\"How is that even physically possible?! I must be dreaming!\"\n\"Not at all. In fact, I believe that you are experiencing some sort of lucid dream, which is an experience that is relatively common",

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

The silence stretches out uncomfortably between us.\nHe breaks the awkwardness by asking, \"So, what brings you here today?\"\nIt feels strange speaking to a stranger, especially one that I've only just met. But I have to trust him. So I begin telling him everything: my symptoms, my fears, my hopes, my dreams, my desires, and even my fantasies. It's all pouring out of me now. As I talk, I realize how much easier it is to speak freely to another person than it is to discuss such things with my friends or family. When I'm talking to Dr. Szozas, there are no judgmental stares or disapproving glares; his face remains neutral, attentive but not judging.\nWhen I finish, he smiles at me, and his smile relaxes me further.

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

It feels like I have lost control of myself. And then I realize that I can't just keep things bottled inside any longer. I've tried too long.\nSo I blurt it out: \"Last night, I had sex with another woman.\"\nHe looks shocked, confused, concerned, and maybe even hurt by what I said. But he doesn't say anything right away. Instead he sits back in his chair, closes his eyes, and puts his hands up to his temples. He's breathing deeply, slowly. I wonder if he'll be mad at me, or if he'll understand. Maybe he already does.\nAfter several minutes he opens his eyes, and asks me softly, \"How do you feel now?\"\nOh, wow. This is really happening. The words come out before I can stop them: \"Better than I ever thought possible.\"\nHe smiles at me, and nods his head. Then he stands up from his chair, and comes around his desk. He pulls out one of his chairs, and invites me to sit next to him. We talk for an hour about everything, including my childhood, my family, my history, my relationships, my sexual experiences, and more.\nIt turns out that Dr. Szozas is very interested in women, particularly female sexuality. He asked me about my relationship with men, and about my past relationships with both sexes. I told him about my first boyfriends, about how they treated me, about their attitudes towards masturbation, about oral sex, about anal sex, about kissing, about cuddling, about foreplay, about intercourse, about orgasm",
