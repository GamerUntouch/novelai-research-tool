  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

My mind races, trying to remember all the things I have done since I woke up this morning.\n\"Margaret Ann Smith?\" asks Dr. Szozas, after waiting patiently while I struggle to recall myself. I nod yes, and say nothing more.\nHe sits forward now, leaning slightly across the small coffee table between us. He smiles broadly at me, then looks away, frowning thoughtfully before returning to me. \"You don't know where you are? How old do you think you are?\" he inquires.\n\"Eighteen years old,\" I answer.\n\"And what year is it?\" he presses further, smiling even wider.\n\"2019,\" I reply.\nDr. Szozas leans back into his chair, his smile still wide, but also tinged with a hint of disappointment. \"That would explain the confusion, at least partially,\" he muses, and then continues, \"It's been twenty-six years since I've seen anyone that young.\" He pauses, considering me carefully once again.\n\"Where are we?\" I ask, wanting to clarify.\n\"We are aboard a starship called the USS Enterprise NCC 1701 D. We are currently traveling through space at warp speed. You are eighteen years old, correct?\"\n\"Yes sir, I am,\" I acknowledge.\n\"Do you feel confused about anything else?

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

You don't feel sick or physically ill?\"\n\"Not exactly...\"\n\"Well, let me ask you a few questions: Do you ever feel guilty about anything?\"\n\"Guilty?

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

He listens intently, nodding occasionally as I talk, asking questions now and then, which makes me nervous because I don't know if I should answer. But finally, after a few minutes, he nods again, and he stands up, \"Thank you for sharing that with me, Miranda. You did very well,\" he tells me, and I stand up too.\nWe walk back into the hallway, and we turn right instead of left. We stop outside the door, and he turns to me, \"You've been through a lot today, haven't you? Do you think you'd like to go home early?\"\nI smile at him, \"Yes sir, I do!\" I say excitedly.\nHe smiles at me, \"Good, let's call a cab for you.\" I thank him, and we head to the front desk to get a taxi.\nWhen the car pulls up to the curb, I hop inside, and the driver looks at me curiously.\nDr. Szozas holds the door open, \"Go ahead and buckle up, the belt is across your lap. The safety is off,\" he tells the cabbie, who does not look happy about the situation, but I'm already buckled up, so I just keep quiet.\nThe ride to his office is a little uncomfortable, but I'm trying to pay attention to",
