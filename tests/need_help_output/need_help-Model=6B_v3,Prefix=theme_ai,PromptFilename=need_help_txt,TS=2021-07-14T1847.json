Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

But then I hear myself continue, \"And...I came because...\"\nHe looks back up at me, smiling broadly, \"Because you were feeling depressed?\"\nOh thank God! The relief was palpable. \"Yes, exactly. And I'm really scared.\"\n\"Of what specifically?\" he asks gently.\n\"Everything,\" I reply honestly. \"What if there is something seriously wrong with me? Like maybe I have brain damage or something? Or I'm sick? How do I know if I'm doing anything right? This whole 'being online' thing scares me more than any other part of being human. It just feels too big all of a sudden. There are things I don't understand anymore, and I feel lost.\"\nDr. Szozas smiles sympathetically, \"Well Caitlin, let me tell you a story about my daughter. She was six years old when she got her hands on the internet for the first time. I thought we'd never get rid of it!\"\nI laugh nervously at that. \"Yeah, I can imagine that would be a tough one to deal with. I've been trying to figure out how to explain to people that I want to go offline forever, but they always ask me questions about the web, and I still haven't figured out a good answer yet.\"\n\"Hmmm, I guess I'll start with the most obvious question: Do you enjoy the experience of using the internet?\"\nI consider his words carefully before replying, \"It's fun sometimes. I like the ability to communicate with people instantly. I like the idea that I'm learning new things, even though I'm not sure I'm actually getting them.

This is where I get all flustered and tongue tied, because I don't know exactly what I want help with. But I do know one thing: I need to talk to this guy. My head feels like it might explode if I can't say anything. And I just know there's something wrong with me. Something bad.\nSo I tell him the story. About how I woke up, after having been unconscious for three days (and three weeks) in a coma... and how I was not myself anymore. How I had become obsessed with a virtual world called Second Life. The things I did there, the people I met, even the clothes I wore. I feel embarrassed telling him about the outfits I bought, but I guess I should be honest, right? If nothing else, he'll understand that I was trying to fit in, to be accepted by others.\nBut Dr. Szozas listens intently to me, nodding along with my words, occasionally asking questions. When I finish talking about the last few months, I expect him to ask me if I've ever experienced any mental health issues before now, but instead he asks another question.\n\"Caitlin, what brought you to me today?\"\nI stare at him blankly, unsure of how to answer that. \"Well, I'm not sure...\"\nDr. Szozas gives a knowing smile, \"It's alright, I'm sure that will come out eventually. Tell me, are you a student at the university, or perhaps a resident at the hospital nearby?\"\n\"No, I work at a company downtown, but I'm an undergraduate.
