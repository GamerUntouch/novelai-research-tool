Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

You don't have to worry about this being a psychiatric issue, we'll do something about it together.\"\nI nod, \"Yes, I know...\"\nHe nods, \"No, I meant,'we'will solve it together.  This will be a private session between us, just the two of us.  How does that sound?\"\nI think about it, and then I say, \"That sounds good. It would be nice to talk to someone about this, maybe even get some advice.\"\nHe nods, \"Very well, let's begin.\"\nWe start talking, and I learn that he is a licensed psychologist, and also that he practices in a clinic where he works with adults suffering from mental illness. He tells me that he sees clients all across the country, and that he specializes in treating sexual dysfunction.  He asks me questions about myself, and I tell him what I've been doing, which is pretty much nothing.  He listens carefully to each word, and when I finish speaking, he asks me more questions, and observes my responses.  It feels like he's taking notes, but he's not writing anything down. Instead, he's listening to me intently, and I feel comforted by his presence.  When I stop talking, he asks me if I'd like to continue, and I reply, \"Yes, please.\"\nHe looks at me, and I can tell that he's impressed with how calm and collected I am. He starts asking me questions, and I answer them honestly, without any fear or anxiety.  He asks me if I ever masturbated, and I confess that I have never done so.\nHe laughs, \"What? You're a virgin?\"\nI nod, \"Yes, I am",
