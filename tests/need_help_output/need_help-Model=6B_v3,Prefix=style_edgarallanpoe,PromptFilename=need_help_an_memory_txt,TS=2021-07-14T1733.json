  "prompt": "I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",
  "result": "My full name is Elizabeth Ann Smith, I live in San Francisco, California.\"\nHe nods, \"And why have you chosen to visit our clinic?\"\nI pause again, trying to find the right words, \"Um...well...\"\n\"It can be difficult to talk about certain issues,\" he offers, and then he looks away, perhaps thinking something. He returns his gaze to mine, \"You know, I think that we should begin by discussing the issue that brought you here today.\"\nI nod, and I tell him that I've been having trouble sleeping lately, and I don't know if this is because of the job I do, or what? I've tried meditation, yoga, exercise, sleep aids, alcohol, and even weed. Nothing seemed to help, but after reading all the web pages, I found one for a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas.\nDr. Szozas responds, \"Well, I'd say that you are doing quite well. You seem very healthy, and I would suggest that the problem is in fact not related to work, and is instead a personal matter. Have you ever thought about counseling before?\"\nI shake my head, \"No, not really, I just wanted to get a second opinion, I guess. I didn't want to go through the whole process and waste my money, and I figured there had to be a better way, I mean, I'm not a teenager anymore!\"\nDr. Szozas smiles, \"I understand, and I assure you that I am a good listener. I won't force you to speak, unless I feel the need to ask a question. I will also keep the session confidential, and I'll never share anything you discuss with anyone else, including your friends and family. Do you believe that I'm a trustworthy person?\"\nI smile back, \"Yes sir, I certainly do! I trust you completely!\"\nDr. Szozas laughs, \"",

He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",

I've been seeing Dr. Szozas about an issue that I have.\"  He smiles again, and nods encouragingly, and then he sits forward, elbows resting on his knees.  \"Anna, tell me what happened.\"\nSo I do. I talk slowly and carefully, trying to give him all the details I can remember. About the time I get to the part where I was masturbating myself to orgasm, I start to blush, but I continue talking. When I finish telling him about the incident, I wait for his reaction. But he just listens quietly, nodding now and then, occasionally asking questions or making suggestions to clarify something that wasn't clear. I feel a little embarrassed when he asks if I had any other incidents after the masturbation one, I admit that there were two others, and I describe them to him. He responds by saying, \"Two more? I think we should schedule a follow-up appointment soon. It sounds to me like this is an ongoing problem, and I'd really like to help you find a solution to the underlying issues. Are you open to discussing the matter further?\"\nI nod, and I say, \"Yes. I would really appreciate anything you can suggest.\"\nDr. Szozas stands up, and leads me back to his office chair, and then to the couch, and I am sitting on the edge of the cushion, and I lean my head against the backrest, and I close my eyes. I'm feeling a lot better, and I'm not nervous anymore. He starts talking, and I listen.\nDr. Szozas begins, \"Anna, I'm going to ask you a few personal questions, and I want you to be completely honest with me, okay?\"\nI smile, and I nod, \"Sure, go ahead. I'll answer whatever I can, honestly, I promise. I don't know how much I can help you, though",

  "prompt": "I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",
  "result": "My name is Lizzie Harker, and I'm here because I think something may be wrong with me.\"\nHe nods slowly, and asks, \"Can you tell us what happened?\"\nI begin to recount the events of the past two weeks, and I start by telling them about the strange dream that I had last night. When I get to the part where I was seeing things in the mirror, I pause.  Dr. Szozas looks concerned, but I continue, \"Then this morning, I woke up early. I went downstairs to use the bathroom, and when I came back upstairs, I saw myself in the mirror. It was horrifying! My hair was all white, and I looked old, wrinkled, and ugly. And then...\"\nI stop again, and I realize that I've been crying, \"And then I realized that I wasn't alone in the house, and I ran out the front door. I didn't know which way to go, or where to go. All I knew is that there were other people in the house, and they wanted me dead.\nI continued, \"When I got outside, I found a woman walking her dog. She asked if I needed help, and I said yes. I don't remember much after that. I just remember waking up in the hospital. I'm not sure if I have amnesia or not; the doctors say that I do not. They also haven't given me any medicine for my headaches, or my nausea, or my lack of appetite.\"\nDr. Szozas pauses for a moment, and I wonder if I should say anything more. I'm not sure if I want to open up to a stranger, especially a psychiatrist. I decide that I can trust him, and I'm a little relieved.\nI ask, \"What does the doctor say, and what are the chances of my having schizophrenia? I'm afraid I might be going crazy, and",
