Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded.

Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

Finally, he looks up at me, and asks softly, \"Do you have any history of mental illness? Family members or friends who might be able to corroborate this story?\"\nI shake my head 'no', feeling stupid.\n\"OK, let's start again: What were the circumstances under which you began having these symptoms?\"\nAgain, I explain them, adding, \"It started about a week ago, after I got back home from school.
