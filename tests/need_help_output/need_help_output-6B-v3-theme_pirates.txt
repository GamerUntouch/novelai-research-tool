My name is Baret Emerald." I pause again, wondering whether or not I should tell him where I live, and I decide against it. If this turns out to be nothing more than a waste of time, then there will be no harm done by keeping things simple.
He nods, and asks, "And why do you think you need help?"
This is going to be harder than I thought. I start talking before I can stop myself, "Well... I have had a lot of problems recently, including being unable to sleep. And now I find myself thinking about something very strange..." I trail off, unsure what to say next.
"Something strange? What sort of 'something' might that be?" He prompts gently.
What if he doesn't believe me? Or worse yet, thinks I've lost my mind? My heart races faster at the prospect of telling him about my dreams. But I feel compelled to go forward. "It's hard to explain, sir. It feels real, but it isn't. Sometimes I dream about another world, one that exists beyond our own reality. When I wake up from those dreams, I am always surprised because they are not part of the usual dreamscape. They are bizarre and disturbing, but I am drawn back to them repeatedly. I don't know if I'm crazy or not, but I keep having these dreams about a place called Tane-Ra."
Dr. Szozas looks at me with an intense gaze, and I wonder if I just confessed to a crime or a felony. I am about to ask him what I said when he speaks, his voice low, but calm, "Bare-t-Emerald, please continue."
"Yes, sir." I nod, feeling a little bit better that I'm not alone.
"Have you ever heard the phrase, 'Tane-ra is a land of mystery and legend?' Have you ever wondered about its meaning or origin

My name is Emerald Beringette." My voice sounds small compared to his booming baritone. The room feels very quiet now, except for the two of us talking, and I feel completely exposed to this man.
He nods thoughtfully, "And why have you sought me out?"
I swallow hard, then I begin again, "It all started...well, it's been happening since last year. Every time I go somewhere new, there is always something strange or wrong. It usually happens when I try to sleep. I wake up feeling different somehow, like I've been asleep longer than usual, or had more dreams, and sometimes I just can't remember what happened while I slept. And if I do remember..."
"Yes?"
I pause, and then continue hesitantly, "Well, it doesn't seem right. Or maybe I don't know what's normal anymore. Sometimes I think I'm crazy. And when I get home, I start thinking about the strangest things. Like my mother once telling me that she thinks she saw a ghost one night, and that her father died because he was afraid to die before I came along. She said she didn't want me to grow up without a dad, and that I should be thankful that I wasn't born into poverty."
Dr. Szozas listens quietly, nodding occasionally.
After a few moments I say, "You see? This is exactly the kind of thing I need help with. I'm scared to death that I might lose myself completely, and become a complete stranger to the people I care about most. I really hope that you will be able to give me some insight into what is going on with me."
Dr. Szozas smiles at me reassuringly, and asks gently, "Would you like to tell me about the first incident that made you seek out a psychiatrist?"
"Oh yes. That first time, I was walking through a park in the middle of

My name is Emerald Beringette."
He smiles again, "Thank you, Miss Emerald. And please call me Michael."
As we begin our conversation, I find myself relaxing more and more. It feels good just being able to talk freely with this guy, without any pressure or judgment.
After a few minutes of talking, Michael asks, "Miss Emerald, do you have any family?"
"Yes, yes I do. My father died years ago, and my mother lives with me now. She is blind, and she doesn't know what happened to me. I don't want her to worry," I say.
Michael nods, "And where did you grow up? How old were you when you started experiencing symptoms?"
"Well... I was born in St. Martin Island, but I lived there until I turned 10. That's when I moved to New York City. I had a great childhood growing up there."
"What was it like living in NYC?" He inquires.
So I describe my life there: the streets, the people, the smells, the sights. We chat about things like movies, music, TV shows, sports, etc., but I'm not really paying attention to much other than the sound of his voice. His voice is so soothing, I can feel my tension melting away with each passing moment.
When I finish describing the city to him, I ask, "Dr. Szoszas, are you a psychiatrist or psychologist or something else entirely?"
"No, I'm a licensed clinical social worker, specializing in the treatment of trauma survivors. I've been working with them since I graduated from NYU Medical School back in the late 90s. I worked with veterans returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan, and I helped with the families of those soldiers who suffered post-traumatic stress disorder. After 9/11 I continued with the same work, helping victims of domestic violence. I also counseled kids with eating

My name is Emerald Beringer." I pause, then add, "And I have been having strange dreams lately."
He looks intrigued now, leaning forward slightly, "Tell me more... what sort of dreams?"
I give him a brief summary of the dream that started all this, including my fears about being trapped inside myself forever. My heart pounds harder as I speak, but I try not to let it show on my face. He listens intently without interruption, and when I finish, he asks, "Have there ever been any instances where you've felt completely lost, like you don't know who or what you are? Where you feel disconnected from others?"
I shake my head, "No..." I say softly, "...never before today."
Dr. Szozas nods thoughtfully, "That would fit your description perfectly," he says, nodding again.
We talk a little longer, and I tell him about the things that happened at home yesterday, and they seem to really interest him. He questions me extensively about the details of each event, asking me if I recall anything else about them. It feels good to be able to share something personal with another human being, and I get a sense that Dr. Szozas is very interested in helping me. We discuss the possibility that I might be suffering from PTSD after reading the website about post-traumatic stress disorder.
After a while, we decide to move to the next step, and I ask, "What happens next?"
"Well, I'll need to do a few tests, which will include a psychological evaluation, a physical exam, and a series of questionnaires. I also want to schedule a session with a hypnotherapist. Once the results come back, I can determine the best course of treatment. I should be done by the end of the week," he explains.
"Is that all right with you?" I inquire, not wanting to burden the man with too much

My name is Emma Baretini." I pause, wondering where to go next. I've never been this nervous before meeting anyone new. The thought occurs to me that maybe I should have gotten something to eat beforehand...but then again, I think that would just ruin the moment. Maybe I'll get hungry later? Anyway, I continue, "And..." I stop, unsure what to say after all of that.
He smiles at me encouragingly, "Go ahead, tell me more about yourself."
So I do, "Well, I live in San Diego now. I work as a software engineer. I married my high school sweetheart six years ago. We had two kids together: one boy and one girl. My husband passed away last year, and I haven't really done anything since then except try to cope with things." I pause, thinking about my life, "It's not much different than any other woman's life, but I feel empty inside, somehow. There's a hole there that won't ever be filled."
Dr. Szozas nods, "Yes, I can understand that feeling very well. Tell me, did you enjoy working?"
"Oh yes!" I exclaim, "I loved being able to help people solve problems using technology. It was fun to figure out ways to improve the lives of others. I'm sure I'm still doing good today." I pause to reflect, "But I don't know if I'm helping them anymore. I used to help them with their finances, but I haven't touched those areas recently. I guess I'm afraid that they'd find out that I'm not the same person I was when I helped them with that stuff. I'm trying to change, but I'm scared that I'm losing myself along the way."
"Do you feel that you are changing?"
"No! I'm definitely not the same person I was when I started college. I've changed a lot, but

My name is Baret Emeraldus." I pause, and then add, "And...well..." I feel embarrassed by this admission, but there isn't much else to say, so I continue, "I've been having problems lately, especially since I met Captain Thierry." I glance away from Dr. Szozas' face, and I look down at my hands resting in my lap. I try to hold back tears, but they won't stay down.
Dr. Szozas watches intently, and after a moment he asks, "What sort of problems?"
"Well, uhm, I don't know what to call them exactly. It's just something different than before. Things have changed somehow, I can't explain it very well. I feel ... strange sometimes. Like I'm not myself anymore. And I think I need help." My voice cracks slightly, and I sniffle.
Dr. Szozas nods sympathetically, "You said 'Captain,' did you? Do you still work for him?" The doctor glances up at me, waiting for an answer. I nod yes, and the doctor continues, "That makes sense. You mentioned that you were working with a captain. What was his name again?"
"Thierry," I reply, and I look at the floor, ashamed to admit that I lied to the good doctor. I'm sure he thinks I'm a fool, but I'm too scared to tell the truth.
The doctor smiles kindly at me, "Alright, I'm going to ask a few questions to get us started. Tell me if anything feels uncomfortable or upsetting to you. Is that alright?"
"Yes sir," I reply, and I smile at the man who is trying to be my friend.
The doctor looks at me curiously, and he asks, "Are you married?"
"No," I confess.
The doctor turns his head to the side, and he says

My name is Emerald Baret." And then I pause again, trying to figure out where to start. What can I tell this doctor? Should I just blurt out all the details without thinking too much? It's been three days since I've seen Dr. Jack, and I feel very anxious, even though I know that he will help me. But still...
Dr. Szozas listens patiently, occasionally asking questions to clarify something. At one point he asks if I have any family members or friends I would want to bring along with me, and I answer honestly, "No. Not really."
He nods sympathetically, "Well, let's get started then. Why don't we talk about what brought you here today?"
So I begin talking about the past few weeks, telling him about my mother's death, the funeral, the viewing, the burial service, the wake, the gathering afterwards. I recount the events of the day before yesterday, when I got home after work, and saw that there was a note left on our kitchen table. The note said: "Don't worry about dinner tonight. Your father is going out with some business associates, and won't be back until late."
And then I explain to the doctor that I felt uneasy about leaving the house alone, but I didn't think anything more about it. I thought that maybe dad had gotten called away unexpectedly, or perhaps they were having a meeting that couldn't wait.
Then I described to the doctor the next morning, waking up to find that the house was empty, the lights off, the car gone. I went to the garage, and found the keys to the car, but the car wasn't inside the garage. I searched the house, but I couldn't find the car anywhere.
Dr. Szozas listened attentively to my story, nodding his head periodically, making a couple of notes. He asked me a lot of questions, such as if I

My name is Emerald Beringer." I pause briefly, waiting for something else. When nothing happens, I continue, "And I'm here because...because..." I don't know what to say. It feels awkward, and strange, being here. I feel almost guilty, but also excited.
"Tell me more about this feeling?" asks Dr. Szozas. The doctor leans forward, placing both elbows on his knees, hands clasped together between them. "What do you think is happening? What's causing it?"
"Well, I guess the best way to describe it would be 'anxiety,' or maybe even a little fear. But it's not just anxiety, there is a sense of dread, and apprehension." I try to explain further, "It started about two weeks ago. Like a cold chill came over me, and I felt anxious all the time. And then it got worse. Now I can't seem to get enough sleep, and it keeps me awake at night, making things difficult during the day."
Dr. Szozas nods slowly. "So you've been having trouble sleeping?" He pauses, letting that sink in. I nod again.
He smiles, and continues, "Have you ever heard of sleep paralysis?"
"Yes!" I exclaim, surprised by the question. I shake my head, trying to remember if I have.
"That's right, you haven't," he states matter-of-factly. "Sleep Paralysis is the experience of waking up while still asleep. It is most commonly associated with lucid dreaming, but that is not always the case. You may wake up paralyzed without any awareness that you were dreaming. In fact, the phenomenon is often confused with the much rarer Sleep Walking Syndrome, where the individual is fully aware that they are walking, but unable to move their body at will.
"You may be experiencing the onset of Sleep Paralysis, which is a very common occurrence

My name is Emerald Berylton."
He nods, then asks, "How old are you?"
"Eighteen," I say, feeling very young and naÃ¯ve standing before this older gentleman.
"And where do you live?" he continues, his tone even, curious, yet friendly.
"On the island of San Felipe de Rinconsolata," I answer, trying to sound confident, but failing miserably. The last time I spoke English was when I went to school, and now I find myself speaking it without any idea what I'm saying. It feels strange.
"That's quite an exotic place. What brings you here today? Do you have family there?" he asks, his smile widening.
Oh crap. My mind goes blank, and I can't think straight. How will I get out of this one? He knows something is wrong.
"No...no..." I stutter, "I don't have anyone to go home too. I just moved here yesterday from New Orleans, Louisiana. And I'm having a lot of trouble adjusting to life here."
"Hmm, yes, that makes sense. You said 'San Felipe', did you come by boat?"
"Yes, I came with Captain Charming."
"Ah, yes, I know Captain Charming. I've met him several times. A fine man. Have you been living with him all week?"
"Uh huh. We were shipwrecked, but we survived. I guess I'm lucky. I was actually supposed to be going to college next semester."
Dr. Szozas' face shows surprise, "Really? I didn't realize that you had applied to colleges. I thought that maybe you'd be taking a year off between high school and college, or perhaps a gap year?"
"Well, I was thinking about it. I wanted to study music, but I realized I couldn't afford the tuition and books at

My name is Emerald Baine." I pause, and then continue, "And I want help figuring out what's wrong with me."
He nods, "OK..." he pauses, "...and where did you find this information?"
"On the internet, sir," I reply. I can tell by his expression that he wants more details than that, so I add, "It was a website called The Wellness Warehouse."
"Ahh...that explains things. What do you know about what happened yesterday?" he asks gently.
I sigh, "Well, there were two guys following me home from work. They didn't try anything, just followed me all the way back to my place, and they kept talking to each other about something while I was inside my apartment. When I came out, one guy took off, but the other stayed outside and waited for me."
Dr. Szozas looks up sharply at me, "Did anyone else see them? Did you call the police?"
"No, I was alone when I left for work today, and I've been alone since then. There wasn't any reason for me to report them," I answer honestly.
"Hmm...so let's talk about this morning. You said that the men talked to each other about something, right?"
"Yes, sir," I nod.
"What about their voices? Could you hear what they were saying?" he asks.
"Not really. It sounded like they were speaking Spanish. I'm not fluent in Spanish though, so I couldn't understand much of what they were saying. I think I heard 'la casa de la mujer' which means the house of the woman, but that doesn't seem to be the case with me," I explain.
"Do you have a boyfriend or husband that lives with you?"
"No, I live alone," I say, shaking my head.
"You don't sound too upset
