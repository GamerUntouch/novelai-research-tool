=== Prompt ========================================
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "

=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Lawrence."
"Lawrence? Like the author?"
"Yes, exactly. That's what everyone calls me."
He nods slowly, "And why are you here?"
I tell him my story, beginning with my childhood, then moving forward to where I find myself now. I explain that this isn't something that can be fixed by any medical intervention. It's more than just being depressed, or even having anxiety. I feel like there is nothing inside of me anymore, that I have been hollowed out.
When I finish speaking, Dr. Szozas sits quietly for a while before saying, "Well, we'll get started tomorrow morning. First off, let me ask you: Do you believe that God exists?"
It catches me off guard, and I say, "Um..."
He smiles again, "You don't have to answer right away if you want. If you'd rather wait until after our session, that would be fine too."
That settles it; I do not need time to think about anything else. "God does exist, yes. I know that He is real because of all the miracles that happen in my life. But I also know that He doesn't always intervene directly to save us from things that are happening to us, or to prevent those things from ever occurring in the first place. I'm sure that many people out there would disagree with me about that."
Dr. Szozas listens intently as I speak, nodding along with what I'm telling him.
Then, when I've finished talking about everything that happened to me, I pause to gather my thoughts.
Dr. Szozas looks at me with a gentle smile, and asks, "What is the one thing that has made the greatest impact on you since the incident with the wolf pack?"
"The fact that I was able to talk to someone about the experience," I reply. I am still trying to wrap my

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Holo."
He nods slowly, seeming to listen intently, "Holo...Holo..." he murmurs, and then after a moment, he looks back up at me, "Well, let's start by getting something clear: this isn't a job interview. You don't have any money, so we'll skip all the usual questions. We can talk more later if you want to discuss payment options. But right now, tell me what happened to drive you to seek psychiatric care."
And so I do. About the strange dreams I've been having, about how they seem to be connected to the mysterious woman named Mary, about how I feel different than normal. And I describe how I had a dream where she appeared before me, and I couldn't move, and I woke up feeling scared. That I felt her touch me, even though I know that's impossible. I explain about the incident with the church, and about how I was confused when I went there, because I thought I'd seen the ghost again.
Dr. Szozas listens quietly throughout my story, nodding occasionally. When I finish, he asks, "You say that the woman in your dreams is a spirit?"
"Yes, sir!" I answer enthusiastically.
"Are you sure? Are you certain that you weren't just seeing things?"
"No, I wasn't!" I protest.
"Then I would suggest that you visit a medium or spiritualist to confirm that the visions are real," he offers.
"What?!" I exclaim.
"Don't worry, I'm not suggesting that you believe a fake. I'm saying that if you think that the images are genuine, then I recommend that you get an expert opinion. A medium or a spiritualist will be able to determine if the apparition is a true spirit, a hallucination, or a delusion brought about by stress. I'm sure that you understand the distinction, yes?"


=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Myuri."
He nods. "And why have you come?"
This question is harder than it looks. If there were any way I could tell this doctor all the things that had happened since arriving at the inn, I would do so without hesitation. But that isn't possible. There are many reasons that I can only explain vaguely, such as "because I want to know what's wrong with me".
There are other things I need to say, too: "Because I don't think I'll ever get better if I stay by myself", "Because I miss my family", "Because I've been alone before, and I hate it". And yet none of those words will come out easily.
So instead, I answer simply, "It doesn't feel good."
Dr. Szozas listens quietly. He smiles gently, and then asks, "Can you describe the feeling? What exactly does it feel like?"
When I try to put into words what I'm experiencing, the sensation becomes clearer. It feels as though something is inside me, twisting and turning. As if an invisible hand is trying to tear me apart.
"...like I am being torn up from within."
"Hmm..."
As I talk, Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair and leans forward slightly, his hands clasped together. His lips are pursed in thought, and I realize that I must look just as perplexed to him.
He stands up, "Let me ask you a few questions. Have you ever felt that something was tearing you up from the inside?"
"No...not really."
"Have you ever experienced anything similar to that? Any hallucinations, or hearing voices?"
"Not that I recall. I haven't heard a voice since I was a child, but I don't remember that happening at all."
"Do you believe that you are possessed by demons?"
"Possessed...? No,

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Myne Havero." I pause after saying this, realizing that I have never given any other name than 'Havero.' But then again, I've only ever used one name: Holo. The last time I gave another name was when I registered myself as a merchant with the guild. This was because they wanted all merchants to use their own names instead of using the common ones. It was also due to the fact that we had received many complaints about people trying to steal our goods.
When I give this information, Dr. Szozas nods, "And?"
So I continue, "You know what happened to me yesterday, right? And you probably already heard about what happened today. Well..." I feel awkward talking about my condition, but I can't help it. "Well...it feels like I'm having some sort of seizure or something."
Dr. Szozas smiles gently and responds, "Yes, that sounds very much like what you might experience during an episode. Let me ask you a few questions, shall I?"
He asks me to tell him about the incident where I went crazy, and I do. When I finish, he looks at me with a gentle smile, and he asks me to explain exactly what I meant when I said that I felt like I was possessed.
"But I didn't say anything to anyone! I just got angry at the shopkeeper!" I exclaim.
"That's fine, but the issue is that the way you acted was different from usual. You were speaking to no one, but your words seemed to be directed at them. I think that you are experiencing a psychotic break; that is the correct term, yes?"
Psychotic breaks are not uncommon among the afflicted. They often end up isolated from society, but that doesn't always happen.
"No, I'm not. I'm still able to talk to people. I just don't want to. I mean

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Myne."
He nods, accepting this information, "And why are you here?"
I feel myself go red, embarrassed by the question. It feels like such a personal question. But then again, I don't know what else to say...
"Because I want to kill Lawrence."
Dr. Szozas laughs loudly, startling me. "You can tell me anything, Myne. You have nothing to fear."
This time I laugh along with him, relieved by his reaction, "Thank goodness..."
"Tell me more about yourself," he prompts.
So I do: "I've always been interested in people, their lives, psychology, history. That sort of stuff."
"That sounds very interesting," he agrees, "and it makes sense that you would be drawn to the study of religion. Your interest in the world beyond our own borders is something I find fascinating too."
"Well, I think there are many different ways to understand the world outside one's home country," I offer.
Dr. Szozas smiles, "Of course. I'm sure we'll talk about all kinds of things today." He looks at me expectantly, waiting for my next words.
I swallow hard, suddenly nervous about talking about myself, "Um...what should I call you? Do you prefer Dr. or Professor or Doctor-Professor or something else?"
"Call me Michael," he offers.
"OK...Michael."
"Why did you decide to become a priest?"
"...because I wanted to help others."
"What made you choose the Church?"
"The order was right. The rules were easy to follow. And I knew I was good at following orders."
"How about the God that you serve? What does that look like to you?"
I shrug. I don't really know. I try to explain to him, "The church is a place where I could learn,

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Holo."
He nods.
"And...why did you send me this email?" I ask hesitantly. My face feels hot, and I'm sweating. The room is stuffy.
"Well, since we've already met, I thought I should tell you something before we meet again."
"...What do you mean? What do you know about me?" I blurt out nervously.
Dr. Szozas chuckles gently, and then sits back in his chair. He looks at me intently for a moment, and then speaks, "Holo, let me explain something to you..."
It begins.
◇ ◇ ◇
"So, what exactly do you want to talk about?"
Dr. Szozas asks me this after I have finished telling him everything: where I came from, what happened to me, and even about my current situation.
When I was done talking, Dr. Szozas just sat there silently, nodding occasionally, his expression unchanging. It took me a while to realize that I had been speaking too much. But now that I think about it, I'm not sure if I actually said anything worth listening to.
As I stare at his unreadable expression, I feel a little ashamed that I couldn't say more than "Uh huh, uh huh", but I also find myself thinking that I probably don't need to be saying all that much either.
After a few moments of silence, I try to break the ice by asking, "Did I answer your questions satisfactorily enough?"
"Yes, I believe that you have answered them well enough to begin with. You are a very interesting case indeed, Holo the Wisewolf. I would like to hear your story, but I must warn you that I am a busy man. I will be happy to give you an appointment to come visit me at the clinic, but I cannot promise that I can provide

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Holo."
He nods, and then turns back to his computer screen. It's hard to tell what he does, though there is one big monitor mounted high above his head, which means that much of the room is taken up by shelves lined with thick books. A few more minutes pass while we wait for each other to speak again. At last he looks up at me. "So, Miss..."
"Holo," I say, completing his thought.
"...Miss...Holo, what brings you to our humble clinic?"
I swallow nervously before responding, "Well, uhm, I have been experiencing strange feelings lately..."
Dr. Szozas smiles gently, and leans forward slightly, resting his elbows on his knees. "Strange feelings? What do you mean?"
I pause, unsure whether to continue or not. My stomach feels fluttery, butterflies dancing through me. "It started when I came across this site called 'the web.'"
At this point I realize that I've just said the words out loud, and I feel embarrassed. The doctor doesn't seem to mind; he simply continues to smile, waiting patiently for me to elaborate.
After thinking a moment longer, I decide to go ahead. "When I went onto the site, I saw a post that claimed to be written by a girl named Mary who had a similar experience to mine. She was a young woman who was raised as a boy, but she was born with the body of a female. And that's where I met her, online, on the internet!"
"Yes, yes, I understand all that," the doctor responds, waving his hands to indicate that I should keep going.
"She was a little different than me, because she was able to transition from male to female easily. But I couldn't! I tried to change myself, but I was unsuccessful!" I explain, feeling a bit frustrated with the whole situation.
The doctor

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Lawrence."
He smiles, "And why have you come?"
"Well..." I say slowly, trying to find the right words. But then they just spill out: "It started when I went to the church, and heard Father tell everyone there that God had chosen them...and that they were special. It was all very confusing, but it seemed important. And after that, I kept thinking about it. I felt something different than before. Something wonderful." My face grows hot, and I pause, hoping that what I've said will seem normal. "That's really all I can think about now."
Dr. Szozas nods thoughtfully, and then looks up at me. "Is this the first time you've experienced anything like this? Have you ever been through any other religious experiences?"
"No, not until recently, but I don't know if I should call it a 'religious experience.'"
"What do you mean by that?"
I sigh, "You'll understand soon enough." I close my eyes, and try to calm myself. The air in the room feels heavy, oppressive somehow. I open my eyes again, and continue, "When I was little, I remember being taken to a place where I saw people living in a house made out of stone, and I was told that I would live with them someday. I didn't want to go, but I knew that I'd be happier with those people than I was with my parents, or with anyone else I met along the way. I wanted to stay with the stones forever. I never left the stone house, and I lived with the family that made up the community. They taught me things about the world, about the sun and the stars. I grew up with the children, and we spent our days together, doing whatever the adults told us. I loved the people that made up the village, but I always wondered why they weren't happy. Why did

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Holo."
He nods, and then asks, "And why did you choose this particular name?"
I think back to my conversation with Lawrence yesterday evening, and I try to explain myself. "It's...it means 'true,' right? It's a word that can be used to describe something real, without exaggeration or falsehood..."
"Yes, yes, good answer," he smiles kindly, and I feel relieved. If there were any other explanation, I would have been very worried indeed.
Dr. Szozas continues, "So what brings you to me today?"
"Well, um, actually, I came because I wanted to ask if I had lost my mind," I say, with a hint of self-deprecation.
Dr. Szozas sits forward in his chair, his face growing serious, "Holo, please don't beat yourself up too much about this. You've been through quite a lot lately. Let's start by talking about that. Tell me, where do you live now?"
"...In the forest near Colton Village. I'm staying with a friend named Lawrence."
"Ahh, the merchant. What does he think about all this?"
"Um, well, I haven't really talked to him about it yet. But I will soon."
"Good. I'd like to meet with Mr. Lawrence later today, to get a better understanding of the situation. In the meantime, let me just confirm one thing with you: Have you ever heard the term 'fantasy world' before?"
"No, not until I met with Lawrence. I was only aware that I was living inside a game, but I didn't know that was a fantasy world or anything. I thought that was normal."
"Fantastic. I'll need to go over the details with Mr. Lawrence later, but that's a relief. I was afraid I might be misdiagnosing you

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Lawrence."
He nods, then smiles again, "And why have you come today?"
"Well..." I start, then pause, unsure how much to say.
Then I realize this isn't just any doctor's office. This is the place where people go when they want something done about their problems. And that makes me feel better right away. It feels good to get help. To let someone else know what's wrong with me. I tell him all about myself: my family, my job, my life, my thoughts... He listens intently, nodding occasionally. When I finish talking, he looks deep into my eyes, and asks, "Have there been any changes since we last met? Any significant ones?"
So I think back on it, and I can remember nothing unusual happening during that time period. But when I try to recall more recent events, I only come up with memories of my work. That doesn't seem important enough to mention, though I suppose it would be relevant if I were asked about my financial situation. "No, not really," I answer honestly, and smile, because I do believe I'm being honest.
Dr. Szozas grins, "Do you have a boyfriend or girlfriend?"
I blush slightly, but I don't deny it, I simply nod, "Yes, I do."
"How long have you known them?"
"About six months now."
"What does she do for a living?"
"She works at a bank."
"Ah, a banker. A very respectable profession indeed. Do you enjoy her company?"
I laugh a little, but I also find his question odd, and I ask, "Why are you asking these questions?"
He shrugs, and replies, "Just trying to figure out how things are going with you two, that's all. We'll talk about that later. First I'd like to give you a few tests,
