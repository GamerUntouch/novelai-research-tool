He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",

She was 18 years old, and we were dating for almost two months. We got along really well, but she didn't want to date anymore. Her parents weren't too happy either, but they let her do whatever she wanted. Anyway, one day I went home early, and I found her masturbating to porn videos on our computer.   I was furious, because I knew exactly which ones she'd chosen, and I was worried that I would catch her doing something similar again. I confronted her, and she admitted that she did watch the same stuff I did, and that she wasn't embarrassed by it. It turned out that she watched the same porno movies I did, except hers were more extreme. I felt bad, and I tried to tell myself that I should just move on, but I couldn't help it. I ended up having a lot of fun watching the porno vids, and I began to wonder if I could get away with watching them without getting caught. I even asked my girlfriend if I could borrow a few for a little while, and she said yes, I guess I can say that I stole the pornos. I snuck into the house at night, hid the box in my room, and I secretly watched the movies I took from my girlfriend's bedroom.

  "prompt": "I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",
  "result": "My name is  . My parents were killed by terrorists, and I survived. I was lucky.\"\nHe nods, and then continues, \"Tell me more about this terrorist attack?\"\nI tell him all about it, how I was shot and stabbed, but somehow managed to survive. The whole time I talk, he just listens intently, nodding occasionally. When I finish, there is silence.\nDr. Szozas breaks the silence, \"And do you feel better now than before? Do you feel like things will get worse if you don't address the issue that led to you being attacked in the first place?\"\nI nod, \"Yes. I think I have to face my past, and confront what happened. It may not bring back those people I loved, but at least I'll know they aren't dead anymore.\"\nDr. Szozas nods again, and asks, \"What did happen?\"\nI start talking about my childhood, growing up in a small town, the local kids teasing me, the bullies hitting and kicking me, the teachers ignoring my plight, the church trying to convince me that God had a plan for me, and I was special, and I would go to heaven. I was raised to believe I was born for a purpose, and I was destined for greatness. I was a good kid, and I tried to be a good person, and I wanted to help others, and I believed I was doing a great job, and I worked hard, and I didn't want to disappoint anyone.\nI tell the story, and I try to explain my feelings at the end, when I was told I wasn't chosen for the afterlife. I felt betrayed and abandoned, and I lost faith in everything.\nDr. Szozas looks at me, and he says softly, \"I understand.\"\nThat's when I realize I've been speaking for a long time, and I'm still sitting on the couch.\nI say",
