  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Andrew.\" I pause again, unsure where this goes next, \"Uh...why am I here?\"\nHe smiles, and leans back in his chair, \"That's a good question, Andy. Why don't we start by talking about what happened today? Do you remember anything after leaving work?\"\nI do indeed remember something strange happening, and then nothing until waking up. It feels odd having a doctor ask questions about my dreams. I feel uncomfortable answering them. \"Yes...\" I say hesitantly, \"There was a dream I had before I woke up, and I felt really bad about it.\"\nDr. Szozas nods encouragingly, \"Can you tell me more about that dream?\"\nI try to think, trying to recall the details of the dream, \"It was a nightmare, but I couldn't wake up. And there were other people in the room with me too, but they weren't real.\"\nSzozas asks, \"Do you know what was happening to you in the dream?\"\nI shake my head, \"No, I didn't have any idea. But it seemed very vivid, like I knew exactly what was going to happen, even though I couldn't control the outcome or stop the events from taking place. I just kept reliving the same moment over and over, but I wasn't able to change the future or prevent the terrible things that would occur. I never wanted to go through that horrible experience ever again!\"\nThe psychiatrist pauses, and I can sense that I've shocked him. His face is serious, and his eyes are fixed upon me. He looks at his notes, and I can see that his lips are pressed together, his brow furrowed, his eyes pensive. He finally speaks up, \"Andy, I want to assure you that I'm not judging you or thinking that you are a bad person. I'm merely gathering information, to help me understand the situation that you",

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

The last time I had any contact with anyone professionally, they were trying to get me to admit to things that I didn't even know were wrong with me. But I can tell that this doctor isn't one of them. He's much more gentle than the other doctors, which makes me relax a little.\nSo I start talking, \"Well, I don't really know what happened...\"\nDr. Szozas cuts me off before I finish saying anything else, \"That's okay, just let us begin by getting to know each other. Why don't you give me a brief history? Tell me where you grew up, and what brought you to the point where you felt compelled to seek professional help.\"\nSo I did as he asked, telling him about growing up in a small town outside Seattle, then moving to California after high school, and eventually enrolling at UCLA. I went to college right out of high school because I wanted to become a lawyer. When I graduated with honors, I got a job with a law firm in Los Angeles, but I quit when I found out I was pregnant.\nThen I met Chad, and we fell madly in love. I was twenty-two years old when I gave birth to our daughter, Zoey. She was born premature, but she is perfect otherwise; I'm not sure if I would have ever given her to another person. We raised her together, and now that she is sixteen, I decided that I needed to find a new career path to support me while I raise Zoey through adulthood.

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is...well...\" My mind goes blank, and I don't know where to start. It feels like this guy already knows all about me, which makes me uncomfortable.\nHe smiles again, \"It doesn't matter, just state what you'd like to call yourself.\"\nSo I do: \"Adrianne Adams, sir. And I want to get better, please help me?\"\nDr. Szozas sits back in his chair, \"Tell me more about yourself Adrianne.\"\nAnd then I tell him things that I never thought I would say aloud. About my parents being abusive, and their drug use, and the fact that they beat me until I was ten years old, and left me alone in the house while they went out partying. That I lived with them after that, and had to clean up after them because they were too lazy to do anything themselves. That I ran away when I was sixteen, and got myself emancipated. The things that happened along the way. How I'm not sure if I can trust anyone anymore, or whether I should even try to rebuild any bridges.\nDr. Szozas listens attentively, nodding occasionally, and asking questions about me that reveal a great deal about my life thus far. He asks about my childhood, about the abuse I suffered, about the drugs I used, about the sexual encounters I've had. I feel very exposed, almost naked, but I also feel safe with the doctor. He is sympathetic, but firm; he is gentle, but demanding; he is knowledgeable, but non-judgmental; he is patient, but wants me to be honest with him.\nAt the end of our conversation, Dr. Szozas tells me that I am a brave young woman, that I am intelligent, that I have the capacity to overcome whatever challenges I face, that I am a good person with potential to be an excellent counselor. He encourages me to continue working with him",

He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
