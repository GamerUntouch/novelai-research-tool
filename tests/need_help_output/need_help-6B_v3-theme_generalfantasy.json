Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

I steel myself, and begin, \"Well, um... It started one night after work...\"\nA few hours later, I feel drained, exhausted, relieved, and happy. As I leave his office, I know that I can trust him completely. The fact that he doesn't ask any questions, just accepts what I say without question, tells me that I don't need to explain anything further.\nLater that evening, I email Dr. Szozas to thank him for taking time out of his busy schedule to meet with me. I also send him a copy of the video of me being raped by my boss. He responds right away:\nDear Miss Jorgenson,\nThank you very much for coming to see me today. I enjoyed meeting with you, and I hope that our conversation was helpful to you.\nAs I mentioned in our phone call earlier today, I do specialize in unusual cases, such as yours. In fact, I'm somewhat surprised that you were able to identify me from the website photos, which are not particularly flattering or revealing.\nYou asked me to state the facts for the record, and I will do so briefly.\nFirst, I should point out that there are many forms of rape, each with their own particular characteristics. I am not trying to suggest that your case is unique or unusual; rather, I am simply pointing out that the situation you describe is within the range of possibilities that I deal with regularly.\nSecond, I must caution you that the details of a sexual assault are often upsetting and difficult to discuss. However, I strongly recommend that you try to be honest with me",

One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

How much worse could things get than they already are?\nThen I hear myself saying, \"It started when I was about fifteen years old, when I saw a ghost.
