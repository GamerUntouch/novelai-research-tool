=== Prompt ========================================
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "

=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Amanda." I pause again, then continue, "I'm sorry, but I can't tell you much more than this right now. It would probably be better if we met somewhere else, perhaps another time?" I feel anxious and embarrassed, because I don't know where to go next. I should have brought a friend with me, maybe? But what do friends really do for people like us?
He nods thoughtfully, "Yes, let's meet elsewhere, if you want to talk about it. You mentioned that there was something strange happening to you recently, correct?" He asks, leaning forward slightly.
I nod.
"Well, I'd prefer to discuss this privately, rather than in front of other people. Would you mind terribly coming back tomorrow morning, say 10am? We'll need to arrange an appointment beforehand though, if possible."
"10am sounds great, yes."
"Excellent, please give me a call when you get home tonight, and I'll send you directions to my office." He stands up, "I'm happy to help, Amanda. Please come by anytime." And with that he smiles at me, and I smile back, and I leave his office.

When I arrive at the hospital the following day, I find a parking space near the main entrance. I walk to the reception desk, and I ask the nurse at the desk to direct me to the psychiatry department, she does, and I follow her directions to the door labeled 'Psychiatry', which I open with a keycard I was given. The room inside is small, but it is neat and clean; the walls are painted a light green, the carpet is dark brown, and the furnishings are all white plastic. I am led to the chair at the end of the desk, and I am told to wait.
After about ten minutes, a man enters the room with a friendly, confident stride. His hair is

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Zoey Smith."
He nods, "Thank you Zoey. Now please tell me what brings you to this office today?"
I begin to explain my problem: the strange feelings I've been having since waking up after being unconscious for three days; the bizarre dreams; the feeling that something is wrong with me; the sense of alienation and loneliness... all of which have caused me great distress. As I speak, I realize that there is more than just one issue causing me concern; I feel as if there are several problems, each with its own unique symptoms, but they seem to overlap and intertwine somehow. The more I talk, the more I become aware of the depth of my issues. And then I get to the part where I lost consciousness and woke up alone; I shudder involuntarily when I say those words. That was the worst moment; the thought that I had left everyone I loved behind was unbearable. But now that I know what happened, I can understand better how I got into such a predicament. It wasn't anything terrible; nothing that couldn't be fixed by talking about it with a good therapist. Just another day at work, right?
Dr. Szozas listens intently to my story, nodding occasionally to show that he understands me. When I finish, he sits silently for a while before speaking again. "Zoey, I think we need to do some testing to determine exactly what is going on with you. I'm not sure if I should be telling you this yet, but I'll give you the gist of things, and if you agree to continue with the tests I recommend, I will share the results with you at the end of the session."
I nod enthusiastically; I don't want to keep secrets from Dr. Szazas. "Go ahead, I'm listening!"
"OK, well first off, I'm not sure if I should be doing any kind of drug or chemical testing at all.

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Annie Smith."
He nods, and asks, "And why did you contact me?"
"Well, I've been having problems sleeping lately... I can't seem to get to sleep..." I tell him, then pause, thinking hard. This is probably the most embarrassing moment of my life, but I have to know: Am I crazy? Is this all just in my head? Maybe there really isn't anything wrong with me after all? The last thought is almost too much to bear. I feel myself blushing again, but try to push through.
Dr. Szozas smiles, and leans back in his chair, "Annie, let's start with what you do remember. You were born in New York City, correct?"
"Yes, I was born in Brooklyn," I answer honestly.
"You moved to Florida when you turned thirteen years old, right?"
"Yeah, I guess so. That was when we lived with my grandparents in Boca Raton."
"What year was that?"
"That would be '98. It was the summer before high school started. My parents divorced shortly after that."
"Your father remarried, correct?"
"Uh huh, I think so. I don't really keep track of things like that. I just want to focus on now, I guess. What about the divorce?"
Dr. Szozas looks at me with his eyes wide and his eyebrows raised, "The divorce was finalized in 2003. Your mother took custody of you, and you stayed with her until the end of the following September. She died from cancer two months later."
A cold chill runs up my spine; I had no idea that I'd lost both my parents at such a young age. I look away, feeling ashamed at my lack of empathy towards them. I knew that they were dead, but I didn't realize that I felt nothing at their passing. I try to shake

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Sherry, and I came because..."
He holds up a finger, "One moment please." He stands up, and goes back over to his chair, then returns to stand beside the couch where I am seated. "Sherry, I'd like you to think about what happened today, and try to remember any details. Can you do that?"
I nod yes, and I feel myself relax, and I start talking: "Well, I went to the grocery store this morning, and I got home just before lunchtime. And I started getting hungry again...so I decided to go out to eat for lunch instead of making something, and I ended up buying two sandwiches. But when I tried one of them, I couldn't finish it. It tasted awful. Like it had been microwaved too long or something. So I threw the other sandwich away. Then I realized that I hadn't eaten anything all day except that sandwich yesterday, so I thought maybe I was feeling sick because I wasn't eating right. So I bought another sandwich, and I ate that one, and it seemed fine. Except now I'm really tired, so I want to sleep."
Dr. Szozas nods slowly, and sits back down in his chair, "OK Sherry, I have a few questions for you. Are you a vegetarian? Do you have allergies to foods or medications? Have you ever suffered from depression, anxiety, or panic attacks? Has anyone close to you recently died? Or experienced a sudden change in their life circumstances?"
I shake my head no to each question, and I say, "No doctor, I don't know if I've felt depressed, anxious, or panicked at all lately. I never even considered that I might be suffering from an illness until I read about it online. I didn't realize that I could get ill like that!"
"You were diagnosed with bipolar disorder by a licensed psychiatrist after a thorough evaluation, correct?"

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Amanda...and uh..." My mind goes blank after this point, and all I can think about is how much I want to impress him. And then I realize what I just said: "And uh..?"
He smiles again, "You don't know your own name? That's quite common among people suffering from DID."
DID? Oh crap, did I really say that out loud?! Now I feel even more self conscious, and I try to backpedal. "No, I have multiple personalities. I guess I didn't tell you that part yet."
"Oh yes, we've already covered that topic. How many do you have?"
Now I'm feeling silly, "Well, I have three right now, actually."
"Three? Wow, that sounds very manageable. You should let me examine you to get a better idea of what's going on inside your head."
I nod slowly, "Uh huh."
"OK, well, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and if any of them seem strange or inappropriate, please stop me. OK?"
"Yes sir."
Dr. Szozas looks at me carefully, and I wait patiently for his next question. He asks me to describe the first personality I ever had, and I begin, telling him about being six years old, and about my parents divorcing when I was five, and about the feelings I felt when they split up. I go through the whole story without skipping a beat, and I end up crying a little bit when I finish talking about my dad leaving. I pause, wiping tears off my cheeks, and I look at the doctor. He nods encouragingly at me, and I continue.
After a while, I start describing the second personality that I started having when I was thirteen. I talk about the first time I got drunk at a party, the first time I kissed a boy, the first time I masturbated

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Kim."
He nods, "And why do we meet?"
Well, there's only one reason: "Because... because..." What can I say? I don't know what to tell this wonderful man, and I feel stupid and awkward. This isn't supposed to happen to me. I thought I had all the answers.
"Kim, let me ask you again, please state for the record your full name, and why you're here," he asks gently.
So I repeat myself, "My name is Kim. And I think I have a problem."
He smiles kindly, and leans forward, "Tell me more about that 'problem.'"
That sounds good. That sounds safe. But then I realize that maybe it doesn't sound quite right, and I pause before continuing. I've never talked to anyone about anything personal before, except when I was growing up, and even back then I didn't really talk much about feelings or emotions. Now I find myself talking to a doctor, and I'm not sure if that makes me vulnerable to him. "Um, well, I guess that would be a long story," I begin hesitantly.
"No need to hold back, just give it to me straight, Kim," he encourages me.
Oh god, I hope I'm doing the right thing. I look up at his face, and I see that gentle smile, I hear his encouraging tone, and I feel a little better about telling the truth to someone else about something that's been bothering me since I woke up yesterday morning.
"OK, OK, I'll try," I start slowly, trying to organize my thoughts, and I look away from his eyes, which are staring at me intently. I look down at the floor, and I take several deep breaths, and I continue with my explanation.
When I look up at his kind brown eyes, I see that they are smiling at me now, and

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Rachael."
He nods, then asks, "Rachael...what brings you here?"
Oh boy, this is hard. It feels good to talk to someone who cares. But I feel embarrassed. How do I explain? What would other people think? What should I tell them? My brain scrambles, trying to find words that will give the right impression, while still being true.
And then, just before I can speak again, a thought pops into my head: Why not just say what I want to say? No one else knows anything about me, except maybe my parents, and they've never known much about me anyway. And if anyone finds out later, it won't matter because I'll have left Earth by then.
So I open my mouth, and I begin to talk. I start out haltingly, but as I go along I get more confident. I tell him about all the things I'm feeling, and when I finish talking I realize that I don't really know where to stop. The doctor listens intently, nodding occasionally, asking questions to clarify points or confirm facts. When I finally run out of steam, he looks at me, "You seem very distressed," he observes, with a slight smile.
"Yes," I admit, and I sigh.
"Well, I'd like to try something different today," the doctor offers, and I nod, curious to hear what he might suggest.
"How long have you been having trouble sleeping?"
"Uh..." I pause, thinking about the question, then I answer, "Since I was about 12 years old."
"Ahh, I see," the psychiatrist says, with a sympathetic expression, "that must be difficult, especially since you were a child."
"Yeah, it was rough," I agree, with a wry grin.
"Do you remember any incidents that happened during that period that stand out to you?"


=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Kelly Lacey." And then I pause for effect, "And I'm here because..."
He cuts me off, "Because?"
"Well...because I can't seem to stop thinking about sex," I blurt out, and I blush furiously. My heart races, and I feel embarrassed by what I just said, but I don't know how else to explain myself.
Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair, and looks at me thoughtfully, "Have you ever had any sexual thoughts that were not related to masturbation?"
I shake my head.
"So if I asked you right now to tell me the last time you masturbated, would you do that? Would you answer honestly?"
Again I nod yes, ashamedly.
"OK, well there are a lot of different reasons people might have trouble controlling their libido, and we'll get to those later. But first things first: What triggered this visit today?"
I sigh deeply, "You."
Dr. Szozas raises an eyebrow at me, and smiles, "What did I say to you that got you all hot under the collar?"
I look away sheepishly, "It was when I saw that picture of the doctor in the magazine. It made me think about getting a medical degree, about becoming a doctor. I wanted to be a sexy doctor with a big dick!"
The room goes silent; Dr. Szozas' mouth hangs open slightly; his eyes are wide with surprise. He swallows hard, and manages to squeak out, "Um, wow!"
I am mortified at what I've blurted out, but I can't help it; I'm not sure what I expected to happen. I am a little disappointed, but I am relieved that I didn't really hurt his feelings or anything.
But Dr. Szozas doesn't look upset; instead, he is smiling at me, and I

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Veronica, and I came because I have been having problems."
He nods encouragingly, waiting patiently for me to continue.   "Well... I think I might be losing control of myself..."
A deep frown crosses his face, and he leans forward in his chair. "Tell me more about what you've noticed lately?" he asks gently.
So I tell him about the things that seem different, and how I feel weirded out by them. It sounds very strange when I say it out loud, but Dr. Szazas just listens attentively until I finish. When I finally run out of steam, he pauses for a moment before speaking again.
"You know, there are lots of ways to lose touch with reality: drugs, alcohol, gambling, sex addictions, etc. But usually people don't get this far without something else happening too," he observes thoughtfully. He looks back up at me with those warm hazel eyes. "Have you ever experienced any trauma recently? Something bad that happened to you?"
"Yes, I guess so," I admit reluctantly. The doctor seems to sense that I'm not being entirely forthcoming, and prompts me further with another question.
"What was it that made you want to seek professional help?"
Oh God, I can't believe I said that out loud! I blurt out the truth, "It was when I saw the video of that poor girl getting raped!"
The man sitting across from me doesn't even flinch. His expression remains unchanged, his eyes still fixed upon me.
"And did that happen at the same time that you started feeling differently about yourself?"
"No! That was a long while ago, but I felt really guilty about watching that!" I explain, embarrassed that I had to bring that part into the conversation.
"OK, that's understandable. So, after seeing that video, you started to feel like you were becoming someone other

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Anna." My heart races as I tell him this information. I feel more relaxed now that we've begun our session together. It feels good to have someone else care about me, and to know that they will listen to all of my problems and concerns.
He nods, "And why do you think you're here?"
It occurs to me that maybe I should begin by telling him what happened...but then again, perhaps I shouldn't. But I want to get this out there before things go any further, "Well..." I pause, trying to decide if I should explain the whole story or just give him a summary of events.
Dr. Szozas gives me a reassuring smile, "Go ahead."
So I start off with a quick recounting of the night prior, leaving out nothing, and I try not to sound too embarrassed or ashamed, "After dinner, I went back to my room, and I was reading when suddenly I felt something, a presence. At first it wasn't scary, but it did seem sort of malevolent, almost evil. I tried to ignore it, but it kept getting stronger, until finally it took control of me. And the next thing I knew, I was fucking another guy!" I say, blurting out the words without thinking about them first. I can't believe I said that word out loud!
But Dr. Szozas doesn't react negatively; instead, his face shows a mixture of surprise and concern. "You didn't know that would happen? You never thought that might happen?"
Oh shit! I blurt out, "No, no, I don't understand what's happening!"
"Anna, I need to ask you some questions about the event that occurred last night, if that is alright with you. Is that OK with you, Anna?"
"Yes, I guess. Go ahead, I'll answer anything I can. I'm sorry, I don't really
