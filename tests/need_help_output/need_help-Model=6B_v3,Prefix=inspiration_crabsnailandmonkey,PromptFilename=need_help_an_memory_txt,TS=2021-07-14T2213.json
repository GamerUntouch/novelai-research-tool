Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it.

  "prompt": "I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",
  "result": "My name is Hachikuji. My family moved away from home a few years ago.\"\nHe nods, and looks back at me, waiting patiently.\n\"Um... I've been seeing a doctor named Kagenui─for issues related to this case. She said I needed to go somewhere else, though she didn't say where...\"\n\"Ah, yes, I know Ms. Kagenui. The two of us have worked together before, but I'll leave her off the hook for now. It sounds like she simply wasn't able to provide any information on your situation, correct?\"\n\"Yes. That's what she said. But I don't understand why I need to talk to another therapist. Can't you tell me what the problem is? Or at least give me a hint?\"\n\"Well, I'm afraid I can't do either of those things. You see, I'm not a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist. I only practice in a very specialized field, which means that I am unable to diagnose or treat you or anyone else. I am a counselor, however, and as such, I will help you through the process of sorting out whatever is troubling you, and then we can move on from there. If I may ask, did you come to me because you were referred by a friend or relative, or perhaps a school counselor or teacher, or maybe a classmate?\"\n\"Nope, I came to you on my own. I was just browsing the internet, and I found a website for a counselor, and I thought I'd check out their services. I think they recommended you, actually. I guess I was hoping that you might be able to help me figure out my problems, or at least point me in the right direction.\"\nDr. Szozas nodded. \"I see. Well, I suppose I should get started, so let's start at the beginning. What exactly is it you want to talk about, and how",
