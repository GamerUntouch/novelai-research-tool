=== Prompt ========================================
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "

=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Cathy Blythe."  He nods, and then looks away. My heart thumps hard against my chest. It feels good to have been recognized by this stranger. I've always felt awkward around people, especially men, and I've never really had anyone to talk to about it before. And now...well, he knows who I am.
Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair, and lets out a long sigh. "Cathy..." he murmurs, "...you don't know what this means to me. To hear your name again after all these years --" he pauses, "-- well, it's like hearing a song you haven't heard in ages, or seeing a movie that you can't remember watching. You just feel better somehow, knowing that there are others out there who care about you."
I swallow, "Um, thank you." I blush a little bit, embarrassed that I'm making such an idiot out of myself. But it doesn't stop me from blushing more deeply when Dr. Szozas continues to stare at me with those deep brown eyes.
"So tell me, Cathy, why are you here?" He asks gently. I look up at him, and I try to compose myself. "Well, I think that I'm having a problem with my memory. I keep forgetting things, and I want to find out if I am experiencing any other problems that I may not be aware of yet. I also wanted to ask if I should be concerned about the fact that I am not sleeping very well at night."
Dr. Szozas' eyebrows raise a fraction, "Are you tired? Do you feel exhausted, sleepy, lethargic, depressed, anxious, irritable, forgetful, confused -- anything like that?"
"No, not exactly." I shake my head. "It's more like I am feeling unusually awake during the day, but I am unable to sleep at

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Neferneferuaten Tefy." I pause again, wondering if this is all right. My heart thumps hard against my chest. "Neferneferuaten means 'Beloved by Re,' which is the Egyptian goddess of creation, order, protection, fertility, and healing. The second part is...Tefy..." I stop there because I don't know what else to say.
Dr. Szozas nods thoughtfully. "You may call me Michael, if you wish." He smiles at me encouragingly. I nod slowly. "Now tell me, Neferneferuaten, why do you think you came to see me?" He asks quietly, and I feel myself relax slightly.
So I tell him about the strange dreams I've been having. About the sense of being watched, followed, observed. How I felt compelled to go through the web and find help. "And then I saw a psychiatrist online, and emailed him, and he said that he would meet with me if possible." I gulp. This is really happening, isn't it? I can barely believe it.
He sits back in his chair and folds his hands together on top of his lap. His expression is thoughtful. His head is tilted to one side, and I get the impression that he is listening intently to something that only he hears. I wonder what that might be. I'm nervous, but I try to remain calm.
After a moment, he looks up at me, his smile is reassuring, "This is a very interesting case," he states, and I feel a little better about the way things are going.
"Tell me about the dreams," he prompts. I start to talk, describing them to him as best I remember.
Dr. Szozas listens patiently to me describe the details of the dream. When I finish, he pauses, and leans forward, his elbows resting on his knees.

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Susan Latham." I pause, wondering if this will get me anywhere, then continue, "and I'm here because I have a problem." I stop again, trying to figure out where to go next, what to say. I'm pretty certain there isn't much more to tell than that.
He smiles encouragingly at me, waiting patiently.   "Go ahead, please."
I feel myself relax slightly, knowing that he won't judge me or mock me or anything else like that. This guy really wants to help people, and I can sense that he genuinely cares. That makes me feel better, even though I don't know exactly how yet.
So I begin, "It all started when I was 13 years old..."
* * *
Susan finished her story with a sigh, and leaned back against the headboard of her bed. She closed her eyes, reliving the memory of that night: she had been lying awake in bed when the dream came to her. It was a vivid one, and although it wasn't a nightmare, she remembered feeling terrified by the images that flashed through her mind. The most prominent image was of herself tied up, naked and helpless, while a group of men watched and laughed at her. Her body shuddered with revulsion at the thought.
She lay quietly for a few minutes, until she felt relaxed enough to return to sleep.
A loud knock at the door jarred her from the reverie. "Yes?"
The door opened slowly, revealing a young woman with long brown hair, wearing an expensive-looking suit. "Hello? Are you Miss Latham?" the woman asked politely. "Your appointment is ready for you now."
"Oh... okay!" Susan replied, getting out of bed. "Just a minute!"
The nurse smiled at her as she left.
Susan walked to the bathroom to brush her teeth before heading to the appointment room. When she entered

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Renee."
He nods, "And what brings you to my practice?"
"Well..." I begin hesitantly. "This past week, after I looked up information on online dating sites, I started having nightmares. They were very vivid, involving women being murdered by men. And then there was this one dream where I saw myself killing a woman who had been cheating on her husband. The next day I went to work, and something seemed off. It felt wrong, and I couldn't put my finger on what it was. But I knew something wasn't right, and I tried calling in sick, but they insisted that I go to work. That night I dreamed again, only this time it was more intense than before. When I woke up I was shaking uncontrollably, and I just couldn't stop crying. My boss took pity on me, and let me leave early. I didn't want to tell anyone about the dreams because I was afraid that I'd lose my job if I did. After all, people might think I was crazy or unstable. Anyway, I ended up coming here today to get some help with them. What do you recommend?"
Dr. Szozas smiles, "First things first, we'll have to talk about the nature of the nightmares. Do they involve any specific details? Are the murders realistic, or are the scenes surrealistic?"
"Both actually," I admit. "The dreams are extremely detailed, and the women are always killed in the most horrible ways imaginable. Sometimes the killer is a man, other times a woman. I've seen everything from strangling, stabbing, shooting, to drowning. I'm not sure, but I feel like I'm reliving the events. I'm not sure how to describe it, but I can't seem to escape the nightmare. I wake up screaming, sometimes I even wet the bed." I'm babbling now, but I don't care

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Lily Gray."
He nods slowly, waiting patiently for more information. It feels like forever before I continue, and this time, I begin with the basics: "I've been having dreams since last night."
Szozas raises one eyebrow slightly, "Do you know what they were about?"
"No, actually..." I pause again, then go ahead and tell him about the dream I had earlier today. The part where I killed my sister.
Szozas listens intently, nodding along throughout, until I finish describing the dream. He looks pensively at me for several seconds after I'm done talking. "So...you think you may have murdered someone in your sleep? That doesn't seem likely to happen often. But let's get back to the details of the dream itself. You said you killed her?"
"Yes, I did. In fact, she was already dead when I woke up, so maybe that means I really did kill her. And I don't remember doing it at all. Not even the smallest memory of killing her or anything else."
Dr. Szozas leans forward, "You're not sure if you dreamed it or if it happened real life, are you?"
"Well, I guess I'm not entirely sure either way, but I'm leaning toward the latter. I'm pretty sure I didn't do it, but I can't be certain."
"Have you ever experienced something similar before?"
"Not exactly. I've never had a dream about murder, but I have a recurring nightmare about being trapped inside a car that is about to crash. I'm always terrified by that dream, but I haven't ever felt the need to act out that particular fear."
"Hmmmmm..." Dr. Szozas ponders that for a few moments, while I wait expectantly. Then he asks, "What about the other things that are happening to you? Have you noticed

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Abigail Brown, and I've been having trouble sleeping." The words tumble forth without much thought, and I feel silly saying them aloud. My hands shake slightly, and I place them in my lap.
He nods slowly, then sits back in his chair, waiting patiently. I swallow hard, trying to calm myself, and start again. "I have been experiencing sleep disturbances since last year. It started with insomnia, and progressed to nightmares, which I can't remember now. Sometimes I wake up crying, or shaking uncontrollably, or sweating profusely." I pause, gathering my thoughts. "And sometimes I just get scared, and I think I'm losing control of things. And I don't know what's causing this. I guess I should tell you more, because maybe that will help us understand each other better."
Dr. Szozas looks up at me and asks, "What do you mean by 'things', exactly?"
I gulp, feeling embarrassed. I answer carefully, "Well... uhm... well, I guess I would say that I'm afraid that something bad might happen to people close to me. Like I may hurt or kill somebody. Or even worse than that, that I'll become violent and attack a person. I mean, I try not to be violent, but I also don't want to be a victim. I guess I'm not sure if I am becoming violent, but I am getting very confused about a lot of things. I don't know if I am a good person anymore, but I am a decent one, I hope. I am trying to be responsible, but I am not sure if I am succeeding." I stop talking, staring at the floor.
The doctor is quiet for a long time, before finally speaking, "Abby, I am going to ask you a question that I hope you won't find offensive. Are you gay? That is an entirely normal part of the

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Tia Williams."
He smiles, and asks, "And why do we meet today?"
I explain what happened after my husband left me: the panic attacks, the anxiety, the inability to sleep, the lack of appetite, the feeling that something terrible is happening inside of me. And then I tell him what I've been doing online. I have just finished explaining my search for answers when Dr. Szozas interrupts me, "You know, there may not be any answers. It might be best if you simply let go of this whole idea."
It sounds harsh, but I understand where he is coming from. I had been searching for an answer for years now, but nothing seemed to work. My life wasn't working anymore, and maybe I needed to accept that fact instead of trying to find another way to get back to normal. I am not sure if I agree with him or not, but I nod anyway, "OK. Thank you."
We both sit quietly together until he speaks again, "So, would you mind telling me more about what brought you to our office? You seem very concerned about something. Are you worried about losing your job because of all the stress, or perhaps about the possibility of having a mental breakdown?"
Oh no. I hadn't thought about that at all. I blurt out, "No, no. That's not it at all!"
He smiles at me reassuringly, "Then why are you here?"
I am relieved that I don't need to lie, but I can't help but feel that I am hiding things. I say, "Well, I'm afraid that I am seeing a shrink, a counselor, and I'm a little embarrassed to admit that I'm a woman who is seeking therapy for her problems."
Dr. Szozas nods, and says, "I think that's perfectly fine. We are professionals; we are trained to deal with such issues."


=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Emma." And then I pause again before continuing, "Emma Tiberius..." and then I stop myself because this isn't really any of my business. But I continue anyway, "...Tiberius." My throat tightens as I speak her last name aloud, and I feel tears prick at the corners of my eyes. She was right, she should have been allowed to keep her identity secret. This whole ordeal is just too much. Why did they even bother bringing her back? What good does it do them? They've already taken away her family, her friends, and now her life. It doesn't matter anymore what happens next, whether or not she gets to live. There's nothing left to lose, except perhaps her sanity.
Dr. Szozas listens attentively, taking notes as I go along. He asks questions, and I answer honestly, telling him everything. The more I talk, the calmer I become, until finally I'm finished talking and I find that I am calm. I glance up at Dr. Szozas, and I see that his face is lit with excitement.
He stands up, "Well Miss Tiberius, I think we can start by getting to know each other better. Would you mind if I ask you a few personal questions?"
I nod, and I begin to tell him about the events that led up to the kidnapping, and the things that happened after I was brought to the hospital. I describe the treatment that I received, the medications that were administered to me, and the thoughts that I had during those times. I also explain the dreams I experienced, and the memories that I have of the past. I don't mention the voices, I don't want to get into that yet; I'll wait to see if the doctor wants to pursue that line of inquiry.
As I proceed with the story, I realize that I am becoming increasingly relaxed, and I am able to recall the

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Kaitlin Kelly." My father had asked me not to tell anyone else this part, so I don't mention that I'm also known as Kaitlyn, Caitlin, or Katie. But I feel safe telling Dr. Szozas this much: I've been having nightmares ever since I can remember. And now they're getting worse...and more frequent. I get scared by them, and sometimes I have trouble sleeping through the night because of them. The worst one I ever experienced involved a monster trying to kill me while I slept. It felt real enough that I woke up screaming, and my mother came running. She found me covered in sweat, shaking, and she held me until I calmed down. I think maybe I'll never sleep again without something to help me relax.
He nods his head slowly, "Tell me about the dreams..."
So I do. I talk about the monsters, the fear, the feeling of helplessness, and finally I describe what happens when I wake up after a nightmare. That's where it gets weird. I always seem to find myself standing outside of my body, watching the events unfold inside of it. Sometimes I'm a bystander, other times I become the victim, or the aggressor. I say all of this to Dr. Szozas, and I wait patiently for his reaction.
After a few moments, he leans back in his chair, "What does that sound like?"
It sounds crazy! I want to scream, but I bite the words off before I speak. "Well, I don't know. I was thinking that I was experiencing some sort of split-brain phenomenon. Like a brain tumor or something. I haven't told anybody about this yet, but I was wondering if I should seek medical attention."
Dr. Szozas chuckles, "I think we need to rule out any physical causes first. Do you drink alcohol? Have you recently taken drugs, or

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Jessica Cavanaugh." My heart starts pounding faster than usual. What does this doctor know? How much do they really know? The truth is, I've never been to a therapist before, but I want answers. Answers will give me peace of mind, and maybe even hope.
Dr. Szozas nods thoughtfully, and then asks, "And why did you contact me?"
Now, what should I tell him? It can't possibly be good news if I have to go through all this trouble to find a psychiatrist, right? But then again, I don't think there is any other way to get help...
So I begin telling the story of how I got involved with the internet, and how I started reading the websites, and how I became obsessed with finding an answer to the question: "What is wrong with me?"
Dr. Szozas listens intently as I describe the events that led up to my decision to seek professional counseling. When I finish talking, he leans forward in his chair, resting his elbows on his knees, "Have you ever heard the term 'somatic experiencing'?"
Somatoform disorders are a collection of symptoms that occur when one believes oneself to be sick but actually isn't, or vice versa. This is sometimes referred to as somatization disorder or conversion hysteria.
I shake my head, "No, I'm afraid not."
He continues, "Well, it's not uncommon, especially among those who suffer from anxiety or depression. They tend to focus on their physical health, or mental state, more than the average person would. There are several types of somatic experiences, but the most common is hypochondriasis, which is where a person becomes convinced that he has a disease that doesn't exist, such as a cancer or a rare genetic condition. Another type is called malingering, where a patient feigns illness to obtain attention. And the last is the
