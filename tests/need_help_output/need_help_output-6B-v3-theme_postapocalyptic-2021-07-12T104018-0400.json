Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded.

I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him.

Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

I've been having nightmares lately, and they have gotten more intense recently...\"\nDr. Szosazs raises an eyebrow, and asks, \"Do you want to talk about those dreams? Do you think we can help you figure things out?\"\nI swallow hard, and nod. It feels strange talking about this stuff to another person, but I feel better already just knowing that there is someone else out there that understands. \"Yes, please. I'd really appreciate any advice you can give me.

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

I continue, \"Annie Oakley because I shoot things really fucking fast and accurately, and I can hit anything I point my gun at. And 'Oakly', because I have been shooting since I was a little girl, and I grew up shooting guns all day long, and I've shot thousands of rounds through hundreds of different types of firearms...\"\nHe smiles gently again, and nods along with my explanation. \"OK then, Annie, please tell me what happened after you left our last session?\"\nSo I do: I describe the events leading up to the explosion, the strange voices I heard, the nightmares I had, the loss of control I felt when I woke up screaming one morning. When I get to the part where I was fighting off the attackers, Dr. Szozas gets up and grabs an old leather-bound book from a shelf, \"Here we go,\" he announces. He turns to a page near the end of the book, flips back several pages, and finds the right spot. He hands the book to me, and I flip forward, reading the words aloud. \"'A person whose mind is dominated by strong sexual urges may experience violent or even homicidal impulses.'\" I look at him quizzically, puzzled, but he simply shrugs, \"It's a quote from a study done in the 1940s, that I think is still relevant today. You were experiencing a lot of intense emotions, and it looks like they were affecting your behavior. The fact that you kept trying to fight them off is a good sign that you weren't being controlled completely. But I'm going to need more details about the other side of the situation.\"\n\"Well, I don't know if I want to talk about that yet,\" I say hesitantly, glancing at the door",
