He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",
  "result": "My name is Sarah Moore, and I came because I had been experiencing strange feelings since about last month.\"\nHe nods, and then continues, \"You say strange feelings? What sort of feelings?\" \nI tell him all about my feelings, and he listens intently, nodding occasionally, asking questions, and making suggestions. It's fascinating to listen to his responses, his tone of voice changes as he speaks, his body language shifts, his facial expressions change, and I feel myself growing more relaxed. The whole process is quite stimulating, and I find myself wanting to ask him personal questions.\nI don't know what prompted me to do this, but I begin by asking, \"Do you think there is something wrong with me?\"\nDr. Szozas smiles, and shakes his head, \"No, not at all. Your problem is very common, and I've seen many people in the past few years, just like you, who have experienced similar feelings. We call them 'the dark side.'\"\nI nod, and I smile, feeling a little better now, \"So I'm not crazy or anything?\"\nHe laughs, \"Oh, no, not at all! You are absolutely normal, healthy young woman, and I would never suggest otherwise. In fact, we can use the term 'normal' rather loosely in the case of you, Sarah Moore. I'd even go so far as to say that you are a little unique. But, I'm not sure I understand, and I'm a little confused, so I want to hear the story from the beginning. How did you first start to experience these...dark feelings?\"\nI answer, \"Well, I was working on a project, and I started to get the sense that I wasn't alone. I was thinking of my work colleagues, and I began to wonder if they were having a good time at the party. I couldn't help wondering, and my mind wandered to the other attendees,",

  "prompt": "I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",
  "result": "My name is Mary Ellen Smith.\"\nHe nods. “And what brings you here today?”\nI pause again. “Well, I've been experiencing certain... uh... feelings lately, and I thought maybe I should talk to someone about them. And I found this website where people can get advice. It said to email you.”\nHe smiles at me, and then looks off, pondering something. I wonder what is happening inside his head right now. What is he thinking?\nAfter a minute or two, he turns back to face me, and asks softly, \"So tell me more about those 'feelings'.\"\nI sigh, and say, \"It's hard to explain. But I think they might be related to my job. Or rather, my lack thereof. I have a great position at a very high salary at a major company, but I don't feel fulfilled. I know there are other things I want to do, but I'm stuck in a rut. I feel trapped by my career, and I don't know what I want to do next. I just wish I felt better. I feel like I'm missing out on life. I'm not sure if I'm depressed, but I'm definitely not happy. I'm not sure if I need therapy, but I'm not sure if I shouldn't. I'm not sure if I should seek counseling, and I'm not sure if I'll ever find the answer. I guess I'm just wondering if I'm crazy. I really need help. I hope I haven't made a mistake in coming here. I'd hate for my family to worry about me.\"\nDr. Szozas listens intently, and he nods at my responses. He gives a slight smile, and says, \"I understand, and I believe I may be able to help. Tell me, does anything come to mind when I ask you that question?\"\nI think for a",
