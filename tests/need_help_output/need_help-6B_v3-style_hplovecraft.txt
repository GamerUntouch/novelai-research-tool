=== Prompt ========================================
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "

=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Lisa Green."
He nods, and then smiles again, "Yes, we've already met. Please continue."
"Well... umm..." I stutter, wondering where this is leading. I feel very uncomfortable being alone with such an attractive doctor, especially since he knows so much more than I do. And yet, there's something reassuringly familiar about him. Something comforting. As though he were somehow connected to all my past experiences, even those that are still hidden deep within the recesses of my mind.
Dr. Szozas gives me time to gather myself, and he asks, "How long have you been experiencing these feelings?"
"Uhhm, I don't know exactly when they started, but it was probably after I got back from college. It feels like maybe two years now? But I can't really remember anything before then, except just feeling different, off, and not quite right."
"Hmmmmm, yes, I see. You seem to be having trouble remembering things about your life prior to your current condition."
Oh shit, I thought to myself. This isn't good. I hadn't expected that question; I wasn't prepared for it. What was I supposed to say? I didn't want to lie to him, but I also couldn't tell him the truth; that I had no memories at all.
Dr. Szozas looks at me with concern in his eyes, "You are aware that the memory loss is temporary, correct?"
"Yeah, I'm pretty sure of that. I think I read that somewhere online. I'm not really worried about that. I'm mostly concerned about what might happen when I get older. I'm afraid that I won't be able to hold a job or function normally, because I'll forget how to act. I'm terrified that I will lose the ability to form relationships, to interact with other people. I'm scared that I may be unable

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Heather Stilson." I pause there, unsure where to go next.
He nods, waiting patiently, "And?"
"Well... uh..." My mind races, searching for something intelligent to say, "my boyfriend broke up with me last night." I feel myself blushing red, I hate this part.
Dr. Szozas sits back, calmly, "That can happen quite easily, especially if they were not right for each other. Was there anything else? Did he give any reason?"
I shake my head, "No, nothing. Just said we weren't working out anymore." I start to cry softly, "I don't know what happened. It just felt wrong. Like things were moving too fast, and now I'm not sure if I even want to continue dating him."
Dr. Szozas smiles gently, "What do you think caused the break up?"
"Oh God, I don't know. Maybe because I was having doubts about us. He didn't seem to care much when I expressed those concerns. And then I found out that he had been seeing another girl for a few weeks before our relationship started."
"Is she important to you?"
"Yes, very!" I exclaim, "She's really pretty, and sweet, and smart, and funny!"
"Do you still have feelings for her?"
I nod sadly, "Of course I do! She's the one that I've always wanted!"
"So maybe you are not ready to move forward with your current partner yet," he suggests.
I sniffle, "But I thought I should tell you about her. You might be able to help me figure it all out."
"I would be happy to hear about the woman that your ex-boyfriend is with. But first I need to get a better idea about your situation. Could you please tell me about your breakup with your boyfriend?"
"Sure. Well

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Heather Mason."
He nods, and asks, "And why are you here?"
"Well..." I begin, then pause, searching for words... "There's something wrong with me. Something strange."
"Go on," he prompts gently.
"It started last week. It just hit me all of a sudden. Like this weird feeling that there were other people in my house, watching me. That there was a presence nearby. And now I can hear voices talking to themselves sometimes. Or whispering, or laughing. But I don't know what they say. Sometimes I think I've seen things that aren't really there. Things that shouldn't exist. And now I feel like I have powers that I didn't even realize I had until recently. They're starting to manifest more frequently."
Dr. Szozas listens patiently to my ramblings, nodding occasionally, before asking, "What do you mean by 'powers?'"
"I'm not sure. Maybe telepathy? Telekinesis maybe? I don't know. But I'm getting stronger. My senses are sharper than ever. I used to be able to get a sense of where objects were, but lately I can tell if something is metal, or plastic, or wood. I can feel heat or cold without touching them. I can hear better too; I can hear the TV, or the radio playing downstairs, or a conversation happening outside the window when I can't actually hear the words myself. I can read lips when I try hard enough, and I seem to be picking up on emotions from a distance. I don't understand any of it, but I'm having a lot of trouble with schoolwork. I need help. I want to be normal again."
After I finish speaking, Dr. Szozas sits quietly, thinking about what I said. He glances at me, his eyes twinkling, his smile widening a bit, and I suddenly wonder if

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Rebecca Rittenhouse, and I've been having strange dreams."
He nods, then looks back up at me, "And what do those dreams consist of?"
Now I'm starting to get scared again, and I feel myself start to sweat. What should I say? Should I tell this stranger all of the things that have happened to me since last week? That I had nightmares where I was being raped by a demon, and then I saw another one, only this time it was a man raping me instead of a monster. And I'd seen other demons too, running away from something, or fighting each other...
But I don't want to freak out this nice guy. He doesn't seem mad at me, not yet anyway. So I just give him a brief synopsis: "Well, basically I've been seeing monsters and demons in my sleep. It started when I was driving home from work, and I was really tired. The next thing I knew, I was dreaming about a giant wolf chasing after me, and when I woke up I realized that the car radio was playing music at a high volume. But it wasn't until later that night that I remembered the dream, and went to turn the radio off..."
Dr. Szozas smiles at me, "That sounds very typical to me. Are there any others that stand out, that you remember more clearly than the rest?"
I shake my head, "No, none that I can think of right now. There's a few that are kind of vague though. Like I said before, I was dreaming about a woman with red hair that I couldn't see properly, but she seemed familiar somehow, maybe because I'd seen her in the news recently? Or maybe I dreamed about a man that I know, but I didn't recognize his face either. I also had a recurring nightmare about a girl that I used to go to school with, but I never met. She kept calling

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Kelly Morgan."
He nods, "And why did you contact me?"
"Well..." I stutter, "...it's hard to explain...but I think something terrible happened to me. Something bad. And maybe I've done things that aren't right. I don't know if this is normal or not, but..." I trail off, unsure what else to say.
Dr. Szozas smiles reassuringly, "Tell me more about yourself, Ms. Morgan."
So I do, telling him all about myself, including details about my family history. It took a while, but eventually we get to where I had been researching the internet, which led me to finding Dr. Szokzas.
After listening to me talk about everything, he asks, "How long have you felt strange? What started it?"
"It was a couple weeks ago. I'm not sure exactly when it began, but I feel different now than I ever remember feeling before."
Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair, "What do you mean by 'different'? Are you having trouble sleeping? Do you feel tired or fatigued? Any changes to your appetite or digestion? Have any mood swings, depression, anxiety? Do you hear voices, or experience hallucinations?"
"No, none of that really. I just feel ... weird. Like I'm watching myself from a distance. I can't seem to concentrate very well; I keep thinking about one thing, but then I realize I was only half-listening to the conversation. I'm also getting distracted easily, I lose track of time. I don't want to go out, but I end up doing stuff I shouldn't. I just wish I didn't feel like I do; I'm afraid I'm losing touch with reality somehow."
Dr. Szozas listens intently to my words, nodding occasionally, "Yes, that sounds like a dissociative episode. I

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Ashley, I came because I felt... different." I pause, thinking about what I want to say next.
He nods encouragingly, "Go ahead, please tell me more."
So I do: "I've been feeling strange lately. Things have changed since last year, maybe even longer than that. My grades were good before, then they started slipping, and now I can barely keep up with basic classes. I think there may be something wrong with me mentally too. I feel like I'm losing myself sometimes, and it scares me. It feels like I'm becoming less human somehow, or at least not fully aware of what I should be doing. And I don't know if this is just normal teenage angst, or..." I trail off, unsure of where to go with my words.
Dr. Szozas smiles kindly, "Well, let's start by having you fill out a questionnaire, we'll get to the bottom of all of this. Please answer honestly, nothing will hurt anything."
I nod nervously, "Ok."
"Alright, now, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I'd appreciate it if you answered them truthfully. If you find any question difficult, simply skip it. We only need to cover the basics right now. Ok?" I nod again, and I begin to write on the questionnaire.
The first question asks me to describe the changes I've noticed within myself. I write, "It was a little weird when I got home from school one day, I couldn't remember much about the past two days, I was spacing out a lot. I was tired a lot, I didn't eat very well, I was distracted. I was getting headaches a lot, but I was always sleepy afterwards. I was seeing things that weren't really there, and I was hearing voices that I shouldn't be able to hear. I was scared that I was losing my mind, but I wasn

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Elizabeth." And then I pause, wondering if this is really the right thing to do, if this will work out. But I don't know what else to say. I feel myself relax as he sits back in the chair. There is silence between us until finally I continue. "Well, um... I've been having nightmares since last week, and they seem to get worse each night. They started after I looked through the web pages about sleep disorders."
He nods, and gestures for me to go ahead.
"So... I went online, and there were articles by people talking about their own experiences, which seemed similar to mine. A lot of them talked about dreams being too vivid or intense, and waking up feeling like something is wrong with them. I can't explain it any better than that. Some said they'd had recurring dreams where they felt like they were falling, while others said they would wake up screaming because they thought they were dead. Others reported hearing voices inside their heads, sometimes saying things that made no sense. I'm not sure what to think about all this."
Dr. Szozas looks at me intently, nodding slowly, "Tell me more about these 'vivid' dreams?"
And I tell him about the dream I just had:
In the dream, I was walking along a narrow path that was wet with water, and I was trying to keep from slipping and falling into the darkness below. I was holding onto a rope attached to a metal pole that was anchored into the ground, and I was pulling myself upward. I was terrified, but I kept going, struggling to pull myself higher.
Then I woke up, sweating profusely, gasping for air. I was still half asleep when I realized that I was dreaming about the nightmare that I'd had the previous weekend. I sat bolt upright on the bed, my heart pounding, and I tried to calm myself down, but I couldn't stop

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Mary Jane Watson." My mother always called me MJ, but since she died last year, I've taken her maiden name back. I pause again, and then continue, "As far as why I'm here... Well, I think I might have been hypnotized by something online." I glance nervously at Dr. Szozas, and I add, "But I don't know if that's possible..."
He nods, "Yes, yes, quite likely. We'll get there eventually, let's just start with what brought you here today." He leans forward, elbows resting on knees, hands clasped together, "How old were you when your mom passed away?"
"Sixteen."
"And how did this happen? What happened?"
"She had breast cancer. She was diagnosed early enough that they gave her three months before it spread too much. They took out both breasts, and she went through six rounds of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, all kinds of treatments." I sigh. "It was horrible. But we got through it somehow. And when I say 'we', I mean my dad. He stayed home with us while Mom was undergoing treatment. When she passed away, Dad didn't want to go out into the world anymore. It killed him inside. He couldn't handle the pain of losing her, so he shut himself off from everyone else. I was fourteen at the time, and I'd never seen anyone cry that hard, ever. I thought I would die with the guilt of having caused that sadness."
Dr. Szozas nods sympathetically, and I feel a little better. I can tell that I'm not making sense to him, and I'm trying to figure out the best way to explain. I try to put the pieces of the puzzle together, but I'm still missing a few pieces.
"So I guess I'm a bit lost. I'm a junior at the University now, but I'm

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Mary Elizabeth Liddell." I pause briefly before adding, "And this is really embarrassing, but..." I continue, "...my husband died last night. And there were some things...that happened afterwards..." My mouth feels dry, and I feel myself blushing as I try to speak.
Dr. Szozas leans forward, and rests his elbows on his knees, "Oh dear, I'm sorry for your loss. Please tell me what happened?"
I start talking, telling him all about it, leaving nothing out, even though I know that most people would not want to hear about such an experience. When I finish describing the events of the previous evening, Dr. Szozas looks concerned. "So, after you left the party, did anything happen?" He asks, leaning back in his chair.
"Yes, actually," I reply. "It started when we got home, and I had to go pee. There was a strange smell coming from our bathroom. It smelled terrible. Like rotten eggs or something. I opened the door, and saw that one of the toilet tanks wasn't properly closed off. The water hadn't been flushed out completely, and when I went to flush it again, the whole tank came loose. A lot of the water splashed onto the floor, but the worst part was that the drain pipe ended up being exposed. I couldn't believe it! I tried to close the lid, but the handle broke off. I don't remember much else until I woke up this morning, and found that Richard was dead."
Dr. Szozas is quiet, nodding his head. "Hmmmmm, that's quite a story. Did anyone come to the house today? Or call the police?"
"No, I called them first thing. I wanted to be sure that they knew about the situation. I didn't think that the police would do any good. I've never heard of anything like that happening before,

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Amelia."
He nods, and then looks back at me, "And why do you think this doctor might be able to help you?"
Oh boy, here we go again, another test, "Well... I don't know really. Maybe because I've been seeing things lately? And they're pretty weird too. Like little black dots flying through the air, or glowing green balls floating above people's heads. It's scary..."
Dr. Szozas raises his eyebrows, "OK, let's start there: what exactly have you seen recently? Anything else would help us narrow down our search."
So I tell him all about the strange occurrences, starting with the little black dots, and the glowing green spheres, and how I can sometimes feel them moving inside my head, and even hear voices coming out of nowhere. My throat tightens as I describe the sensations, "It feels like I'm being watched by something, or someone... but when I turn to look at whatever is watching me, it isn't anywhere to be found."
Dr. Szozas sits quietly for a moment, "How often does this happen?"
"Pretty much daily now. Sometimes I'll get glimpses of the other side, but only briefly, usually just a few seconds. I try to focus on the vision, but it's hard to concentrate with the feeling that I'm being observed, followed, stalked. I'm scared!"
"That sounds very similar to a case I had last year, a young woman who experienced the same sort of thing; she was a student at the University, and one day she came home to find her apartment ransacked. She thought that a burglar was responsible, but the police determined that nothing was taken, that the place was simply trashed, and that the culprit was unknown. I saw the girl at the time; she was terrified, and didn't want anyone to approach her, but I tried anyway.
