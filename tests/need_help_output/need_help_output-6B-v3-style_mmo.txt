My name is Kirito." And then I pause again, because I don't know where to go next. What should I tell this doctor? My memory is hazy, but it feels like I've been living here for years...so what does that make me? A patient? Or maybe just another resident? Maybe I have a new job now...?
But before I can think any further, Dr. Szozas speaks up: "Do you remember anything about your life prior to waking up in SAO?"
"...No..." I say slowly, unsure whether I should reveal more than I already have. But I decide that if I want help figuring out what happened to me, I'll need to share as much information as possible. Besides, there isn't anyone else I can trust right now.
"I don't remember anything about my past life until about two weeks ago. That's when I woke up in this world after being sucked into a game called Sword Art Online. I was able to log out, but when I did, all the memories of my previous life were gone. At least, that's what I thought at first."
Dr. Szozas looks at me closely, and nods once. "Go ahead, continue."
So I do. "After I logged out of the game, I wandered through the forest outside the town of Rulid, which is the closest settlement to the central hub area. I spent a few days walking through the woods, but I never saw anybody else. I slept under a tree, ate berries I picked off the bushes, and eventually found an abandoned house nearby that I decided to stay at. I used a magic stone to charge my cell phone, and I tried to get online using Wi-Fi but couldn't connect. I had no idea how to use a computer or a smartphone, and I didn't even know what the word 'Internet' meant. So I stayed inside the house, waiting to be

My name is Kirito...Kirito Aincrad." And then I pause again, wondering if this will all go wrong because I don't know what else to say next. But after another moment, I continue: "And I want to get better..."
He nods, encouragingly. "That's good. Now tell me more about your symptoms. What do you think might have caused them?"
So I start talking, telling him about the strange dreams and visions, the weird feelings, the depression, the anger issues. By the time I finish describing my condition, I feel much calmer. It wasn't just the doctor's smile or his appearance; I believe he truly understood what was happening to me. As I talk, I realize that something isn't quite right. The doctor didn't ask any questions about my life history, or anything about myself outside of the present issue. I thought maybe he was being too polite by not asking personal things about me, but now I wonder if there were other reasons for his silence. Maybe he knew exactly who I was, and had already made up his mind.
When I'm done speaking, he sits back in the chair and folds his hands together atop one knee. "Now that we've established that you are indeed experiencing symptoms related to mental illness, let's discuss the treatment options available to you."
It doesn't sound very promising to me; I've never heard of "treatment options" before. I nod, though.
"Well, first off, I'll need to examine you to determine the cause of the problem. We can't diagnose a disease without examining the patient. That means I'd like to conduct a physical examination to check your vital signs, blood pressure, pulse rate, reflexes, hearing, vision, smell, taste, sense of touch, balance, coordination, and movement. I would also like to run a few tests to rule out any underlying conditions that may be causing the problems.

My name is Aincrad Asuna Kirito."
He nods, and looks back down at his papers, "And why have you chosen to visit this clinic?"
Oh...that part was easy. It had been hard enough just to get myself there in the first place, let alone actually tell anyone what happened. But now I've got to do it again: "Well, um..."
"A lot of people don't want to talk about their problems until they feel ready to share them, even with a doctor. And many people can't bring themselves to say anything without feeling embarrassed or ashamed of something."
That was pretty close to the truth, so I nod along. "Yeah, that makes sense."
"But if you ever need to discuss something serious with me, please know that we will keep all of our conversations confidential. We won't ask any personal questions unless absolutely necessary."
Wow, that sounds really reassuring. "Really? Thank you very much!"
Dr. Szozas smiles and nods once more, then turns to face me directly. I find his gaze unnerving, because it is intense yet somehow gentle at the same time. The effect is almost hypnotic, making me wish to answer his question honestly.
"So, Miss Asuna, I would like to hear about your problem."
Huh? I was expecting a long, drawn-out process where I'd go through a series of tests and exams, followed by a lengthy interview with the psychiatrist himself. Instead I was asked to state the nature of the issue right off the bat. This is going to be easier than I thought.
I lean forward and begin speaking, "Um, well, I think I might be having a mental breakdown. I'm not sure. I'm afraid that I'm losing touch with reality, and I'm worried that I'll end up hurting somebody else. I'm also scared that I'll never be able to log out of SAO

My name is Alice Synthesis Thirty-One." My cheeks flush red, and I don't know why. Is this embarrassing? But I continue, "And...well, I've been having problems lately..."
He nods encouragingly, and asks, "How long have you had those problems?"
"Um...about two months now, maybe more than that."
"Hmmm...and where did they start?"
"Well, um...it started when I got back home after being away for six years. It was right before the summer break ended, and I went back to school again. The problem was that everyone knew exactly what happened, even though I didn't want anyone else to find out yet. And then there were all sorts of rumors about me, about how I was depressed because I'd lost my boyfriend or something."
Dr. Szozas tilts his head slightly to one side, listening intently, "Is that true?"
"...No," I say firmly.
"That's good to hear, Alice. You can tell me if it's true later. Now let's talk about your depression instead."
So we do. We discuss my life, my family, my friends, my job, and my hobbies. He listens attentively to everything I say, asking questions only when necessary. When I mention that I used to play MMOs, he grins widely and shakes his head.
"Ahh, the good old days. I remember them well. I played a lot too; I still do, but I also stopped playing a few years ago. I'm glad to see that you're enjoying the same games I enjoyed. I hope to get to try out some new ones soon."
I nod, and ask, "What about the depression? How does that work, exactly?"
"Depression is a condition that is caused by the lack of serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood

My name is Aincrad. In this game world."
He nods, "And why did you choose to visit me?"
"Well..." My heart races. The butterflies begin their dance again, and I have trouble finding words. "...it said that...you specialize in unusual cases."
"Ahh, yes. You've been playing ALO? Good choice. It's a great game."
"Yes, it is. But I don't think anything is 'usual,' really."
"Hmm. Well, let's get started then. We'll start by discussing what brought you to our attention in the first place. Why do you feel compelled to seek treatment now?"
That's easy: because I can't stop thinking about Asuna.
It all began when we were trapped inside the labyrinth tower together. She had just gone through her own transformation into an elf, while I was still stuck in human form. That night, after she went to sleep, I sat up late reading the manual, trying to figure out the mystery of SAO. I felt lost, confused, and scared. I knew that I couldn't stay there forever.
But I didn't know where to go or what to do next. I wanted to talk to other people about the situation, but I also feared being rejected. And if I tried to leave the game, I would never find Asuna again.
So I stayed inside the tower, alone with the darkness, until the morning sun came streaming into the room. I got dressed, left the building, and walked to the town square. There was a fountain with a statue of a girl holding a sword, surrounded by a ring of trees. I stood before the statue, looked at the sky, and cried.
At that moment, I made a decision to follow the path I was on. I was determined to keep moving forward, to search for a way to save Asuna from the curse. I thought that if

My name is Aincrad Elaina Marie Solus." It feels weird saying all those words back-to-back, and I pause after each one, feeling embarrassed by myself. I'm trying to remember where I heard this before... Oh yeah, the web site.
"Ain? What does Ain stand for?" asks Dr. Szozas.
"Ahh..." I say, searching for the right word, "it stands for 'the unknown.' That's what I want to know."
He nods thoughtfully, "OK, then tell me more about yourself. Where do you live now? Who are your parents? Do you have siblings? Are there any problems in your family life? Any trauma or issues in your past?"
So I answer him, "Well, I grew up in Norlangarth, in the city of Maromey. My mom died when I was young, but I still have two older sisters. They both work very hard to support us, they are good people. And I don't really have any problems with them, not anymore. But I think I might be having trouble with my father..."
Dr. Szozas leans forward intently, "What happened between you and your dad?"
"...well, I guess I can start from the beginning. When I was eleven years old, I had a falling out with my father. I went to stay with him during summer vacation, but I got sick with the flu, and I ended up in the hospital for three weeks. I didn't get better until I came home, but when I did, I was different than I'd been before. I was withdrawn, quiet, and I wouldn't talk to anyone. I was afraid to go outside because I was always seeing monsters under the bed, but I couldn't explain to my friends that I was scared. I was also eating a lot less, but I just chalked that up to being homesick.

My name is Akihiko Kayaba." The words pour out of my mouth almost without thought. It feels good to get them off my chest, to say them aloud. To let the world know what happened...what I did. But then I realize that there is something missing from this story: "How do you feel?"
Dr. Szozas looks perplexed by my question. He glances back and forth between me and his computer screen, which shows nothing but an empty white space. "Well..." He pauses, and scratches his head, "It's hard to tell right now. I have a lot to process, too. Can we start again? Your name is?"
"...Akihito Kayaba. And yes, I killed people. At least one person." My throat catches up with me, and I can barely speak past the lump forming in my throat.
He nods slowly, purses his lips, and shakes his head slightly. "Yes, I believe you are correct. Let us begin with an overview. How old were you when you started playing games online?"
"Fifteen, sixteen years old."
"And what was the reason behind choosing that age group?"
"Because I wanted to experience a wide range of emotions while I played games. I figured that if I got hooked early, I'd be able to play longer than if I waited until I was older."
Dr. Szozas raises his eyebrows, but says only, "That makes sense."
"Do you think that I might be addicted to video games, or MMOs, to the point where I'm losing control of myself?"
Dr. Szozas sits up straight and puts his hands together, clasping his fingers tightly. He stares at me intently. "You don't seem to be experiencing any withdrawal symptoms, so I'm not sure that I would call that addiction. But I want to ask you a few questions about the events that led

My name is Aincrad..." My voice trails off there, because I have nothing else to say. The silence grows awkward between us. What do I even tell this man? How can I explain all of this...?
Szozas cuts through my thoughts: "That's fine, just state your full name."
"...Ain...Cratius...Finnick..." It feels strange saying it aloud, but after hearing it once, I feel more confident speaking it. But still, I don't know what to think about myself. Why does my body feel so hot? And why am I sweating despite the cool air conditioning?
"So, Mr. Ainz Cratiau Finnikinsh, please continue with your story," the doctor prompts gently, "You said that you found something online about a psychiatrist?"
I nod.
"Why did you decide to contact a professional about your problems? Do you believe they will be able to help you?"
I open my mouth to answer, but then close it again. I'm not sure if I should share the truth with anyone yet; maybe I'll wait until I've gotten some advice from others.
He continues, "I understand that you may be reluctant to talk about certain things with a stranger, but I assure you that I am trustworthy, and I won't judge you based on any personal information that we discuss. I am a specialist, and I deal with many unusual cases, including those that involve the use of the internet. I am also a member of the guild 'Luminous Arc', which is an organization that deals with cases involving the paranormal. That is one reason that I chose to become a counselor, actually. I am interested in anything that is beyond the norm, and I hope to be able to provide guidance to people who are struggling with their own issues."
I listen intently to the man's words, but I am still confused. I wonder if I really

My name is Aincrad. Or Akihiko Kayaba."
He nods silently, waiting for more. And I continue: "A few days ago, I became trapped inside this game called Sword Art Online, which is a VRMMO. The purpose of SAO is to kill all players except one...and then there will only be one left alive. It sounds insane, right? But it happened anyway..."
And while I talk, Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding now and again, taking notes, asking questions. When I finish talking, he just sits quietly for a moment, before speaking up.
"...It would seem that we have much work ahead of us, Ms. Aincrad. Please tell me if anything changes during our session tomorrow morning. We'll start by getting you checked out physically, then move on to discussing what led to you being trapped inside SAO, and what sort of coping mechanisms you've developed to deal with it. I hope that you can find a way out of this mess soon, though...If nothing else, I'd really appreciate it if you were able to get back home safely."
I nod vigorously. "Yes sir!"

The next day, I wake up early. I don't sleep well at night after I read through the documents on Dr. Szosas' website. I go to the bathroom, brush my teeth, wash up, and put on a fresh shirt (blue today). I eat breakfast and drink a glass of orange juice, then I head to the lobby to wait for the doctor.
Dr. Szozas arrives about ten minutes later. He's dressed casually, wearing a button-down shirt with a tie, slacks, and some shoes. He looks at me, his face serious, and asks, "Are you ready?"
"Yes, Doctor," I say, standing up.
We walk to the elevator, and the doors open.

My name is Aincrad Online... er..." I glance back at Dr. Szozas, "Ainz Ooal Gown."
He laughs, "Oh, yes, we've met before. You were one of those people who came in to see us after the incident at Stachion. And you were quite memorable, weren't you?"
I smile sheepishly, "Yeah, I guess I was."
Dr. Szozas nods, "Yes, indeed. Well, let's get started then. Why don't you tell me what brings you here today? Do you have any particular problem you want to discuss?"
And this is where things start getting weird. I explain to him all about the strange events that had been happening to me lately. When I describe the dreams, he leans forward intently, asking questions, nodding, "So that's what it was. Yes, I can understand that. It sounds rather unpleasant. But I suspect that the content of your dreams might be something more than just nightmares. What do you think about that?"
Dr. Szozas asks me to walk through each dream I remember, describing them in vivid detail. The only thing missing is the actual sound effects; the words are clear enough, but I would really appreciate if he'd put some music or voices in there to give the scene a little extra oomph.
After a few minutes, I ask, "So is there anything I should be worried about with the dreams or the visions or whatever they are? Should I be concerned about losing control or going insane?"
The doctor pauses, and his eyes shift away, "Well, I'm not a psychiatrist, but I am a counselor, and I can say that the contents of the dreams are very concerning to me. I was hoping that if I could examine you a bit further that I could perhaps shed some light on the matter. If I may be frank, I am somewhat skeptical that
