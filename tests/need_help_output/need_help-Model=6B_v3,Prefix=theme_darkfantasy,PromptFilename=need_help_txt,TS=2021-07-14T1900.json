  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

Nightmares, hmm. What do they consist of?\"\n\"Um, I don't know. It's just a feeling inside me. Like something bad is happening, or will happen. And then sometimes, there's this image, or vision, of myself being hurt or killed. Or getting stabbed by a knife, or shot in the head. But I can't remember what happened before those images came up, or what caused them.\"\n\"Hmmm, okay. That sounds very much like PTSD. Can you tell me about any specific triggers?\"\n\"Trigger?

She looked like an angel, but her wings were spread out and I couldn't help but stare at them, because I knew that I would die soon, and I wanted to feel the joy I'd felt when I saw the angels in heaven. I kept thinking that I should try to touch her wings, but I didn't want to upset her. I woke up with a terrible headache, I'm still not sure why, but I'm pretty certain that I need to be careful about touching the wings of the women I meet, or else I'll end up killing myself.\"\nDr. Szozas thinks about that for a moment, \"Hmm, that does sound a lot like a classic case of sexual transference.

    " Or maybe something I drank? I don't know. It just started recently.\"\nHe sits forward, leaning slightly towards me, \"Erika, we can rule out drugs or alcohol. Your brain",
    " is fine. The reason for what you describe is called 'Auditory Hallucinations'. They happen all the time, especially when people are stressed or depressed. What makes them seem worse is that they",
    " are often accompanied by other symptoms: feelings of paranoia, fear, anxiety, nightmares, insomnia, flashbacks, etc. Do you feel any of those things?\"\nI shake my head. \"No,",
    " nothing like that. My life isn't very complicated right now, I'm not sure if that's normal though.\"\nDr. Szozas leans back in his chair again, \"That's perfectly",
    " normal. You are a young woman with a lot to deal with, but that is only natural. Tell me about your family situation. Are you close with your parents?\"\n\"Yes, I am",
    ". Both of them live nearby, but I haven't seen either one since I moved out last year.\"\n\"How about your friends, is anyone special to you?\"\n\"Not really. I",
    " had a few good friends in high school, but I lost touch with them after graduation.\"\n\"Do you work, or study at a university?\"\n\"Nope, I've been unemployed for",
    " the past two years.\"\n\"So, no job, no studies, no friends, no significant others, no siblings, no children, no pets, no hobbies, no interests outside of the internet"

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

It feels good to talk about myself, to get something off my chest. And I feel better once I've finished. My mind drifts back to the questions I had asked earlier online, and I ask them now, \"What should I expect? What do we need to discuss?\"\nDr. Szozas laughs softly, \"Nothing too serious. I just want to know more about you, Emma. We'll go through some tests together, but I think it will probably be best if we meet face-to-face first. That way there won't be any surprises later. I don't want to miss anything.\"\n\"Well, okay...\" I say uncertainly. \"But I have to admit, I was a little surprised when they said 'psychiatrist'. You seem much younger than that title implies.\"\nSzozas chuckles, \"You are correct about that. I'm actually 34 years old, which is young for a psychiatrist, but I'm still considered an adult. I am also a graduate student at the university. I'm enrolled in a PhD program right now; I hope to become a professor someday, but I haven't decided yet whether I would teach or research.\"\n\"Wow, that sounds really exciting!

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

My mind spins in circles, unable to settle on anything specific. I glance back at Dr. Szozas, wondering what he would do next. Would he tell me to just spit it all out? Or maybe ask questions until I get it all out? What if I don't know what to say? But then again, perhaps I should keep this to myself and figure things out later. I feel very much alone, and vulnerable, and confused. The only thing I can think of is: \"I've been having weird dreams lately. Dreams about being lost. Like I'm trapped inside a maze, or something similar. And I have trouble sleeping because of them. I also wake up feeling depressed sometimes, even though I haven't done anything wrong. It's hard to explain, but I think there might be a connection between the two.\"\r\nDr. Szozas listens intently as I talk, nodding occasionally when appropriate. He asks a few clarifying questions, but doesn't push too hard. When I finish talking, he sits quietly, thinking. I watch his face, and I am struck by the fact that his features are almost identical to those of his twin brother, Michael. I wonder if they are twins, but I cannot bring myself to ask. I wait patiently for his response.\r\n\"Caryn, I am going to refer you to another doctor that specializes in dreams and sleep disorders, but before we go any further I want to be sure that I understand the situation correctly. Are you saying that you are suffering from insomnia and nightmares due to stress, anxiety, depression, and/or other emotional issues that may be contributing to these problems?\"   \"Yes, sir.
