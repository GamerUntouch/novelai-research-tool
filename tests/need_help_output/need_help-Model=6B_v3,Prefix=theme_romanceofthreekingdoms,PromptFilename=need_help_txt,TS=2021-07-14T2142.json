Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him.

At times he would pause briefly before replying to something I said. It seemed that he had already heard most of what I had just described. He asked me if there were any other symptoms I was experiencing.

I looked at the clock: 3am! I threw off the covers and jumped into the shower. The water was cold, but I felt refreshed and alert. I dressed, ate a quick breakfast, and was ready to leave.

    "ping outside the window. I looked at the clock: 3am! I threw off the covers and jumped into the shower. The water was cold, but I felt refreshed and alert. I dressed,",
    " ate a quick breakfast, and was ready to leave. I took a cab to the airport, and I was surprised to find that it was already daylight. I got to the gate, checked the board"

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My full name is Sui Shaozi.\"\nHe nods slightly, \"And what brings you here?\"\n\"I have been feeling strange lately, I can't sleep very well, sometimes I feel dizzy... there are times when I think I hear voices...\"\nDr. Szozas leans forward a little, \"What do you mean by 'voices?'\"\n\"When I go outside I often get this urge to just walk off somewhere. Sometimes I find myself thinking about things that aren't really important, but then I realize that I've forgotten what they were about.\"\nDr. Szozas looks concerned, \"Do you know where you might be headed?\"\n\"No, I don't even remember where I lived before coming here, or anything about my family back home.\"\nDr. Szozas smiles reassuringly, \"It sounds like you may be experiencing some sort of post-traumatic stress disorder. Do you want to talk about it?\"\nI nod slowly, \"Yes please.\"\n\"OK. Let's start with a brief history: Where are you from? What happened to cause you to leave?\"\nSo I tell him all about my life up until now, leaving out nothing. The story is sad but not particularly surprising; I grew up poor in a small town in China, I was the eldest son with two younger brothers. My father was an official and had a good job, but he was not a happy man; he was always complaining about the government and the corrupt officials. He was not a violent man; he was more passive than aggressive. But I knew that if I ever got into trouble at school, I would be beaten to death. And I did indeed get into trouble at school; I was a bad student and I was also a rebel. I hated the system and the way that the teachers and the other students treated each other. I was not popular with the girls, because I was too quiet. I liked the boys",

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Li Na.\"\nHe nods, \"That's fine. Now tell me why you've come?\"\nSo I start telling him my story: The birth of my daughter, her death, my father's suicide, my mother's illness, my own mental instability, and all of this leading up to my current condition. As I speak, Dr. Szozas listens quietly, nodding now and then to indicate agreement or disagreement, asking questions, making suggestions, giving advice. It feels good to talk about things, even if they seem totally bizarre to others.\nAfter listening to me intently for more than half an hour, Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair, \"You know, there are many people who would say that your life is perfect.\" He looks at me seriously, \"But most people don't have such wonderful parents, and children, and friends, and family members.\" He smiles again, \"They have problems too, but not quite the same magnitude as yours.\"\n\"Yes, I suppose that's true.\"\nDr. Szozas continues, \"Your problem is that you are overly attached to your child, and she was very special to you. You loved her deeply, and you feel guilty that you didn't do enough to save her from the pain that you knew awaited her. This guilt, combined with the knowledge that she is gone, is causing you severe distress.\"\nI nod slowly, thinking about what he said.\nHe adds, \"There is something else that is troubling you, isn't there? Something that is bothering you about the way that your mother is doing right now?\"\nI look up at him and reply, \"It is hard to explain. She is...\"\n\"She is dying, yes, I understand that.\"\nI sigh heavily, \"No, I think that is the wrong word... I'm afraid that I'm losing control of myself. I can't stop crying when I am with her",
