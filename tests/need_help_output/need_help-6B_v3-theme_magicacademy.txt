=== Prompt ========================================
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "

=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Zabrisk." And then I pause again, wondering if I should continue. But I know what's coming next, so I do: "And I'm here because I think I might have been kidnapped by...by something bad..."
He nods knowingly, and looks at me with a knowing smile, and asks, "What makes you say this?"
"Well, um, I've had dreams about people trying to kidnap me, and there were these weird men chasing after me, and they all looked just alike, and one guy kept saying 'we got her', and another said 'she's ours'."
Dr. Szozas listens intently while I talk, nodding along occasionally, asking questions now and then, and finally I finish talking. After a few minutes, he stands up and stretches his arms above his head. He turns to face me, and he smiles kindly at me, "Alexandra, I'm very sorry to tell you that what you described sounds exactly like an episode of sleep paralysis. You may not remember any of it when you wake up, but if you try to recall anything specific about the dream, I can help you figure out where the memory came from."
That doesn't sound good. I feel myself starting to panic, and I ask, "Is it dangerous? Is it going to hurt me or something?"
"No, no, nothing like that," he assures me, taking a deep breath before continuing, "Sleep paralysis is a condition that occurs during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, which is the stage of sleep most people enter right before waking up. It is caused by a malfunctioning part of the brain called the reticular activating system. When the RAS malfunctions, the body is unable to move or speak; the person is paralyzed, but consciousness remains intact. The only way to overcome the paralysis is to will the muscles to work."
I nod slowly, but I don't really understand

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Zabrisk." I pause before continuing, "And...well, I think something happened to me last night, after I went to bed..."
"Yes?" prompts Dr. Szozas.
So I tell him what happened: I had been working late on the computer, and then decided to go to sleep early. When I got back to my room, I felt strange, tired, sleepy...and there were voices coming through the wall. I tried to ignore them, but they just kept getting louder until finally I opened my window to listen more closely. They were speaking in Russian, and I couldn't understand their words, but I recognized one person's voice â€“ Marina's. She was talking to her friend Katya, and she was telling Katya all kinds of stuff about me, including things about our friendship, and about me being gay, and about me having sex with other girls, and about me liking cock. The conversation was very frank and open, and I heard enough to know that Marina knew a lot more than I did about my sexual preferences, which I found surprising but not shocking. But then Marina started asking questions about me and Katya answering them honestly. And then the two women laughed together, and I suddenly realized that they thought I wasn't listening, because I'd gone silent.
When I turned off my light, I slept, but I woke up a few hours later with a splitting headache, feeling sick, and I didn't want to get out of bed. I wanted to stay there forever, but I eventually forced myself to leave the warmth of my blankets and go to the bathroom. I took a shower, and I brushed my teeth, and I ate a piece of toast, and I put on some clothes, and I went downstairs.
It seemed that I had missed the party, and I saw that everyone else was still sleeping. So I made some coffee, and I sat at the kitchen table with the laptop and

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Kallos." I pause, wondering what to say next, then continue, "And I have been seeing things... since I was fifteen years old. I've tried several therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, all of them couldn't find anything wrong with me, and they all said that I was just having 'delusions.' But I know that isn't true. It's real. I can feel it inside me..." I stop talking because Dr. Szozas is staring at me intently now.
He leans back in his chair, folds his hands together, and purses his lips thoughtfully. "Alexandra, what do you think happens when we die?"
Oh God, this again? The answer should be obvious, right? I don't want to talk about death, I'd rather discuss something more interesting: boys! Or maybe girls!
"Well, I guess I'll go to heaven or hell, depending on whether I'm good or bad when I die."
Dr. Szozas laughs heartily, "That's a very common misconception, Alex! We aren't born into one world or another after our deaths, but instead move between worlds based on our actions while alive. That is the most basic tenet of magic, and the foundation of the afterlife. If we act virtuously, we will end up in a better place than if we acted wickedly. You may also be surprised to learn that there are many different types of heavens and hells, each with their own rules and regulations. And yes, people who are bad are sent to hell, but only if they were truly evil. Most often, those souls are judged by the gods themselves, not a human being, and if the person is deserving of punishment, they are cast out of the heavens to be punished forevermore. Good deeds are rewarded, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the individual is given a spot in the heavenly kingdom. In fact, the best

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Zabrisk." I pause again before continuing, "And...um...because I need help..."
He nods encouragingly, then asks, "What do you think you need help with?"
Wow, this guy knows exactly what to say. I feel better already. And I realize that maybe I've been having trouble making decisions because I don't know what I want. Maybe I just haven't had time to figure things out. That makes sense to me. But now that I have an opportunity to talk to somebody else about this, I can get more information and make an informed decision. I decide to tell him about all the weird stuff happening with me. It feels good to finally open up about something.
So I start talking about my strange dreams, about the fact that I keep seeing people die, and about the way I suddenly changed after meeting Katie. "It was really scary when she died," I admit, "but there was also a part of me that felt happy about her passing away. Like I wanted to help her go." I stop myself. This isn't a conversation about religion.
Dr. Szozas listens intently to my story without interrupting or asking any questions. When I finish telling him about the dream where I saw Alexia and her mom arguing about whether they should kill themselves, I hear a small chuckle escape his lips. He looks at me quizzically, but I'm not sure if I heard him correctly.
"You said that you were sad about their deaths, but that you also wished that they would end their lives? Did I mishear you?"
"No, that's right!" I exclaim. I hadn't even thought about that aspect of the dream; I'd simply focused on the argument between the two women. I guess I'm not the only one who finds the whole suicide thing disturbing.
"Well, that is a very interesting perspective. I'm going to write that down,

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Zabrisk."
He nods, and then responds, "Alexandra, please tell me what brings you here today?"
So I begin, "Well... um..." I falter again, and feel myself blush slightly. "It all started last week when I saw something online that said I should talk to a psychiatrist. And I did, and she gave me this website address to contact you, and I have been emailing you ever since."
Dr. Szozas smiles gently, and asks, "And what do you think you saw that caused you to seek psychiatric help? What happened?"
I swallow nervously, feeling somewhat embarrassed by the whole ordeal, but not knowing quite how to explain it without sounding completely insane. "Last Wednesday night, after school, I went home, and I couldn't sleep, because I had a dream where I was walking through a dark forest, and there was an old woman standing next to me, and she looked really sick, and I tried to get her attention, but she wouldn't move, and I woke up crying."
Dr. Szozas looks at me sympathetically, "Was anything else going on that day?"
I shake my head, "No, nothing. I don't know. I just felt weird that day, but I didn't want to say anything to anyone, especially Mom."
He chuckles softly, "Did you talk with your mom about the dream?"
I nod, "Yeah, I told her that I'd seen a scary movie at the theater, and I wasn't sleeping well, but I didn't mention the part about the old lady, or the woods, or the fact that I dreamed about the woods. She suggested that I might be having a bad reaction to the new medication I'm taking, but I don't believe that's true."
"Have you mentioned the dream to any other family members?"
"Nope, I haven't.

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Zabrisk."
He nods approvingly, "Thank you for being patient. Now tell me more about this... 'unusual case.' Can you elaborate?"
So I do, telling him about the strange dreams, about the changes within myself, about my odd behavior and inability to concentrate.
When I finish talking, Dr. Szozas looks thoughtful, then contemplative. Finally, after several moments, he speaks again, "You know, I have had many patients similar to you, but not nearly as extreme as yours." He pauses briefly before continuing, "What I find interesting about what you've described is that there appears to be an underlying cause: something traumatic happening during childhood that has led to the development of these symptoms. Are you aware of any such events or occurrences in your past? Anything that might account for this sudden change in personality?"
I think back, trying to recall anything significant enough to explain all of this, but nothing comes to mind. I don't even remember most of the things that happened when I was little. But then again, maybe I did experience something, and didn't realize it at the time.
Dr. Szozas asks me to describe a recent dream I experienced last night, and I try to recount the details, but I can't get them straight.
After I'm done describing the dream to Dr. Szozas, I ask, "Do you believe that I may be suffering from a psychological disorder?"
He considers my question carefully, "It's certainly possible. I'd need to conduct further testing to determine if that's the case, but I'm willing to give you a preliminary diagnosis. You appear to be experiencing a major identity crisis, which is very common among teenagers. It's perfectly normal, but it does tend to be accompanied by some anxiety. What worries me is that the source of the problem isn't clear, but it could be caused by various factors. For example,

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Zabrisky."
He smiles, "And what brings you to see me today?"
"Well...I've been having problems with magic lately, specifically spells. It feels wrong, somehow. And there have also been issues with my body, physically. For example: I can barely sleep anymore because I keep dreaming of being attacked by wolves, or something like that..."
"OK, let's start simple then, please tell me what happened last night after dinner. You ate dinner alone, correct? What did you eat?"
"Yes sir, I had a pizza delivered. A pepperoni one, which was pretty good actually. It wasn't too spicy though."
"Did you drink any alcohol while eating?"
"No, just water. But I think I drank a little wine before bedtime, maybe two glasses?"
"Any other substances ingested prior to sleeping?"
"Not really, except maybe some coffee earlier this morning, but I don't know if that counts."
"Alright, now we'll move onto the next incident, a few hours ago when you were walking home from school."
"Oh yeah, I was late getting back to the dorms, so I walked the whole way to get to the bus stop, and I got off at the corner store, where I bought a bag of chips, and I didn't even realize that I'd left my keys in the car until I went to unlock the door, and the door wouldn't open, I tried to go inside but I couldn't, I ran back to the door and banged on it a couple times, but nothing would happen. So I started to walk back to the dorms, but I kept hearing a wolf growling behind me, and I turned around and saw the door slamming shut behind me, I looked up at the sky, but the moon was hidden behind clouds, and the stars weren't visible, but the air felt cold and damp

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Zarev." And then I tell him more: "I have been having strange dreams lately... nightmares..." My heart sinks. This isn't working. Maybe this is too hard? But then he smiles at me again, reassuringly, "That's great. Now just relax. Tell me what happens during those bad dreams?"
And I do, I describe them all. The ones where I'm running away from something terrible, always being chased by monsters or ghosts, feeling like I'm drowning or suffocating, falling asleep while trying desperately to keep myself awake. It sounds silly, but I feel awful describing it to him because I know that he won't laugh or dismiss me out of hand, he'll listen carefully and ask questions.
He nods at me, encouraging me to continue, and I do.
It goes on for quite awhile until finally he asks me a question, "Have you ever had any similar experiences before?"
Oh god, I hope not. What if they've become part of me now? I can't possibly remember anything else. "No sir, nothing like that," I answer honestly, and I don't want to lie to him.
Dr. Szozas looks at me intently, and then he tells me, "You know, I think I might be able to help you with this problem. I would recommend that we meet regularly, perhaps weekly sessions, to discuss your problems. I will be asking a lot of personal questions, but I promise that I am a professional who respects confidentiality. I am also a very experienced therapist, and I'm sure that I can help you. Do you agree to that?"
"Yes, I guess so, I'm desperate, I need to get better, I'm afraid that I'm losing control of myself," I reply, and I really mean it.
"Excellent! I look forward to getting to know you, Alexandra. I'm sure that I can help you

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Zabrisk." I pause briefly, then continue, "I'm eighteen years old, and I have just been diagnosed with Paraphilia: Sexual Trauma Syndrome by a Doctor named Dr. Mark Johnson, which apparently means...well..." I trail off, not wanting to offend this wonderful doctor.
He nods slowly, seeming to understand. He smiles broadly again, "And what brings you to me?"
"Well, after reading through the web, I came across a website called 'Paraphiliac Disorders,' where they said that there were several different types of paraphilic disorders â€“ sexual trauma syndrome being one of them. They also mentioned that most people with paraphilic disorder are never even aware that they have such a condition until they've had extensive therapy. The website suggested that I contact Dr. Michael Szozas if I wanted help, because he was supposed to specialize in unusual cases. And I thought that maybe you would be able to help me with my problem."
Dr. Szozas' smile fades slightly, but only momentarily; his face returns to its normal expression, "Your diagnosis was correct. Your symptoms are consistent with a variety of paraphilic conditions. You appear to be suffering from a combination of three separate problems that are all interrelated, and I will need to address each one separately before we can begin to work together to treat you. To start with, let me ask you some questions. Please tell me about your family history."
So I describe my parents, brother, and sister; the fact that I grew up in an upper middle class neighborhood; that I went to a good school, graduated at the top of my class, and I've always done well academically; that I'm an A student at the University; that I'm a virgin; that I don't date; that I'm a virgin; that I'm a virgin; that I'm a virgin; that I'm a virgin; that I'm a virgin

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Alexandra Zabrisk." I pause briefly, then continue, "Alexandra means 'hope', which is fitting since I hope this meeting goes well."
He nods slowly, and smiles again, "Well done. And why are you here?"
I feel myself blushing slightly, "Because... because..." I stutter, "because I want help."
He leans forward, "Tell me more. Why do you think you need help? What have you tried so far?"
I explain what happened last night, and how I felt after seeing Mr. Jones. How I didn't know if I was being paranoid or not. The feeling of unease, of dread, of fearfulness. Of wanting to run away. Of wanting to stay.
Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding along. He asks questions, asking about the feelings, the sensations, the thoughts, the images. It's all very clinical, yet also personal. I start to relax a little, as we talk about the events leading up to me coming to the clinic. I tell him about my parents, their deaths, and how they affected me. About my life growing up, my school experiences, my friends. I describe the strange things that happen when I go to sleep, the dreams I've had, the nightmares I sometimes have.
As I finish describing the dream where I saw Mr. Jones walking through the trees, I realize I'm holding back something else that I haven't mentioned before. Something that I'm afraid to admit to the doctor. I look at his face, his eyebrows raised expectantly, waiting for me to speak. I swallow hard, and say softly, "And I don't know when I'm going to wake up."
I'm surprised by the immediate compassion that I see in his eyes, "That must be terrifying to live with."
I nod, "It is."
"Have you ever been to a psychiatrist?"
