=== Prompt ========================================
I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
[Period: Modern Day]
[Year: 2020 AD]
[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "


=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Mandy. My parents were killed by a drunk driver back in '87, when I was just 16 years old."  
He nods, and then asks, "Do you have any siblings?"  
"No. I had one older brother, but we didn't get along very well. We fought all the time. He was always picking fights, and trying to provoke me. It got to the point where I couldn't stand being near him. I tried to avoid him, but he would follow me everywhere. He even followed me to school once, and started throwing things at people in the hallway... People yelled at him to leave me alone, and he did eventually go away. But the next day I saw him again, and this time he was following me home from school..."
I stop talking for a moment, remembering that awful day. I can still remember the smell of his breath, and the sound of his footsteps, and the way his eyes stared at me in that hateful, mocking, ugly manner. I felt sickened by the sight of him, and I hated myself for feeling that way about my own family.
Dr. Szozas continues, "Mmhmm, I see. I'm sorry for your loss. I'm sure that you must be hurting right now, and I understand. Please continue, I want to hear more details about what happened.
I nod, and begin, "I came out of my house, and there he was, standing across the street from my driveway. I stopped, and he crossed the road to meet me, and when I turned to walk up my drive-way, I noticed that he was carrying a baseball bat in his hands. I knew he'd been drinking, and I knew he wanted to start a fight with me. I decided to ignore him, so I kept walking up the path, and when I reached my front door, I looked over my shoulder at him.

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Chris Adams, and I've been seeing Dr. Szozas about... something." I feel silly admitting this much, but I can't seem to stop myself.
He nods slowly, and then asks, "Would you mind telling me more?"   I tell him the details, including the fact that I'm married, have two children, and live in Colorado Springs. I don't mention the reason for my visit, but I do say that I want help figuring out what's wrong with me. He listens intently, nodding at times, shaking his head at others.
When I finish talking, he sits back, closes his eyes, and rubs them. When they open again, he smiles at me, "Chris, I think we may just be able to help each other out."
I laugh, "Really? I was hoping for a prescription for a new medication, or a referral to a therapist or a psychiatrist..."
Dr. Szozas looks at me, and he leans forward, his face earnest, "No prescriptions, and no referrals; I'd rather not get into that right now. I'm not a doctor, I'm a counselor, and a good one. We'll start by getting a little background information. Tell me a little bit about yourself, and the nature of the problem that brought you here today."
I sigh, and begin my story. I talk for a few minutes, describing my life, my wife, my kids, my job, my hobbies, my interests; I even give a brief description of my relationship with my ex-wife.
Dr. Szozas is smiling, and I'm feeling a bit nervous. I glance at his eyes, and I'm thinking, "Oh my God, I'm going to cry. What did I say to bring that on?"
Then I hear a chuckle, and I realize I was the only person in the room. The laughter is infectious, and I

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Samantha...Samantha Smith." I pause, trying to find the right words, "This isn't easy for me to say..."
He nods encouragingly, leaning forward slightly, "Go ahead, tell us what's been troubling you."
I sigh, and begin again, "It all started this morning. I woke up early, before dawn, I guess. I couldn't get back to sleep, but I was worried about something. I don't know why, exactly, but I decided to go outside for a walk. It was cold out there, and dark, but I wanted the fresh air. As I walked along the road, I saw a car crash into one of those big concrete pillars. The pillar fell to pieces, and crumbled into dust as soon as the impact hit it. I watched as the driver got out, and I heard her scream, "Help!" I ran to the scene, and I found the woman slumped against the side of the building. She had blood running from a cut on her head, and she looked dazed. I tried to help, and then another person came out, and they both helped the injured woman. I asked them if they needed any help, and I offered to call an ambulance for the lady. They said no, thank you. I left the area after that, because I felt weird watching the whole thing.
I didn't think much more about the incident until I went for a run later that day. I was out for a long time, and I wasn't sure if I should turn around when I finally made my way home. I kept going, though, and I ended up in a park. I sat on a bench for a while, and I thought about the accident. I wondered if the people involved were OK. I also wondered where the man who drove the vehicle was now, and I hoped that he would be alright. I can't explain it, but I just felt compelled

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Charlie Murphy. My father died last year, and left us in debt. We lost our home due to a fire caused by a faulty smoke detector. The insurance company refused to pay out because we were late paying our premiums."
Dr. Szozas nods slowly, and then looks at me again. He asks, "And what do you think happened?"
Well, I know that I didn't want to go through all this trouble just to get my money back, but I can't help thinking about the fact that there was a fire. Maybe the house burned down? But if the house burns down, wouldn't they have said something before now? I don't understand.
Dr. Szozas responds, "Charlie, did the fire occur during a blackout period?"
Blacked out... I stare at him, confused.  What is a black out period?  I ask, hoping to find an answer.
He answers, "It means a power outage, or a failure of the electrical grid. It happens sometimes, especially in rural areas where the power lines aren't maintained. In such cases, the power is cut off for a few hours, or even days, and the backup generators kick in. When the power comes on, the lights come on, and the appliances work.  But the water heater, furnace, etc. will not function until the electricity is restored."
Oh, I see. So, my dad had a generator. That explains the smoke detectors. And the broken one.
I continue, "So, after the fire occurred, the insurance company denied coverage, and the bank repossessed the property. They've been trying to sell the place for months, and I guess the bank foreclosed on the property. 
I looked at the man, who seemed to be taking notes as I spoke. I continued, "The bank is still selling the place, and the price keeps dropping. I'm

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Mary Jane Watson."
He nods, and continues, "And...?"
"Mary Jane Watson? Because..."
"Yes, yes, I know what you're thinking. But we need to get past all this nonsense, shall we?" He looks at me, waiting patiently for me to continue. I feel silly talking about myself when there is something more important happening, but I can't help it - I want to tell him everything, and I don't even know where to start. So I say, "Well, um... my father is a famous comic book artist named Peter Parker, and my mother was a supermodel named Gwen Stacy."
Dr. Szozas chuckles softly, and responds, "I have heard of both those names before.  They sound very interesting. Please go on."
I smile, and begin to talk, "So I grew up watching my dad draw Spider-Man comics, and I wanted to be a comic book illustrator too. And then one day I realized that I wasn't good enough for that, and my dream had died along with my parents. I didn't understand what I'd done wrong, and I felt lost and sad and confused. I couldn't figure out why I hadn't been able to achieve my dreams; I thought I should just give up on them completely, and I decided to become a normal person. I got a job at a fast food restaurant, and I started dating a guy, and I bought a house, and I went to college, and I met my husband, and I became a stay-at-home mom, and I raised our kids, and I tried my best to be happy. I worked hard at my job, I dated my husband, and I made sure that my children were well-behaved and well-educated. I took care of my family, and I did my part to contribute to society. I kept busy, and I never stopped trying to

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Gwen Thorson. My parents were killed by a drunk driver, and I've been living off the grid ever since." 
He nods, and then looks back at me, "And what brought you to us?"
I pause again, and this time I realize that I have never really thought about where I want to go with this. This guy is really good at asking questions, and I need to answer them honestly, even though they might seem strange or awkward to others.   "Well, I got sick of being alone. The world is pretty fucked up right now, and people aren't talking much anymore. There are a lot of things happening that just don't add up, and I started reading the news online, trying to figure out what was real and what wasn't. It seemed like a lot of the information I found didn't match up, and I couldn't find any sources I trusted... So I decided I would try to get away. I went on a trip to Mexico, but I had a bad experience there, and I came home early. I tried a few other places, but I kept running into the same thing everywhere I went, which is that I felt unsafe. I haven't seen anyone in a long while, and I miss having friends. I'm lonely. I'm scared. I can't sleep. I think I may be depressed, and I know I am stressed out. I'm not sure what to do. I feel trapped, and I'm terrified. I feel like I'm losing my mind. I'm starting to wonder if I'm going crazy. I guess I just wanted to come in for a consultation to see if I'm normal, if I'm delusional, if I'm nuts. If I'm sane. And maybe, I'd like to hear from a professional who isn't a complete stranger, and who is a little more approachable than a computer screen. I'm not sure I'll be

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is John Smith. And yes, I have been diagnosed with PTSD by two different doctors."
He nods, encouragingly. I continue, "And I've tried all sorts of things to help myself deal with this issue. But nothing really works. I just keep getting worse and worse... until I can barely function anymore. I think about the past too much. It gets me angry, depressed, and sometimes even suicidal. My wife left me, because she couldn't handle what I was becoming. She said that I had changed completely since we got married, and she didn't want anything to do with it any more. I don't blame her for leaving.   I know that I need professional help to get better, but I don't know where to turn..."
Dr. Szozas sits silently for a few moments, and then asks, "So tell me, Mr. Smith, what exactly is the problem?"
I feel a little uncomfortable being called 'Mr.' I answer, "Well, I used to work for a major corporation. I worked in IT, for one of the biggest companies in the world. I was responsible for the security of the entire company network. I also helped them plan for and execute their annual budget. I did a good job, and I was very proud of my work. I knew my stuff. I kept the hackers out, I made sure the data wasn't compromised, I made sure the backups were working correctly. I loved my job; I felt like I was contributing something worthwhile to the company. I liked the people I worked with, and I enjoyed the challenge. I was happy.
I quit my job, though. I found a new opportunity, and I took it. I thought I'd be doing the same thing, only now for a smaller firm. I started out on the right foot, I made a lot of progress, and I was having a great time. Then I hit a snag.
The

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Jameson Locke."   My heart pounds faster than normal as I tell him this, and I can feel myself sweating a little bit... and then I continue. "And..." I pause again, feeling silly, but I go ahead anyways. "I've been having trouble sleeping lately. Ever since we started getting bombarded by all those meteors, I haven't slept very well. It's hard to get any rest when there's a big chunk of rock crashing through the roof each night." 
He smiles at that, and nods his head, "Yes, I know what you mean. My wife is also experiencing insomnia due to her anxiety about the impending apocalypse. I have a suggestion for both of us, though; do you mind if I share?"
I nod, and wait for his next words.
"You should try meditation. You'll find that it helps you relax and sleep better. I recommend trying the guided meditations available online. There are many different techniques, and I believe the one I use works the best. When I was younger, I was a musician, and I played guitar and piano. I used to practice a lot of scales and chords, which helped me stay relaxed and calm. I'd suggest doing the same. I'll send you a link, and I think you'll enjoy it. I've found the technique to be extremely effective.
I'm happy to hear that I'm not alone in my plight, and I'm relieved to learn that I'm not crazy, and I'm even more excited to hear that I'm not the only person in the world suffering from the effects of the meteor storm! I thank him profusely for his advice, and I promise to give the meditation a shot when I get home.
I stand up and shake his hand, and say, "Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate the time and help you took the time to offer me. I'm sorry for wasting your time

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Mandy Kowalski." My parents were killed in a car accident when I was sixteen years old. I had just graduated high school, and was ready for college... but there wasn't much money left after paying off all our debts, and my dad's life insurance payout. It didn't cover enough for me to go to the University of Michigan, where I wanted to study psychology. I tried to get financial aid, but they wouldn't give any more than what I already received. I applied to several other schools, but none would help.
I was devastated; this was supposed to have been my big chance at getting a degree, and I couldn't do anything about it. The only option available to me was to work part-time jobs until the next year. There weren't many options for people like me; I needed to find something I could do that paid well, and I also needed a job that I enjoyed doing.
I started applying for retail positions, and I got a few interviews, but I never heard back. I decided that I should try a different approach, so I sent out resumes and applications for a lot of fields. I thought maybe a career in medicine, or law, or engineering, or finance. I even tried a couple of internships, and I did pretty well, especially in the medical field. I worked at a hospital for a while, and then I went to a university for a summer, and I studied to be a doctor. I really liked the idea of helping people, and I loved the research I was able to do at the hospital. I still think I'd enjoy a similar position.
But I'm afraid that I'm not qualified for most of those careers. I don't know if I can handle the pressure, or the stress, or if I'll ever become good at whatever it is that I end up trying to do. I've always felt a little out of place, and I'm sure

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Alice Cooper. My mother died giving birth to me, and my father took off shortly after I was born. I've been living alone ever since."   I stop there, because I don't know what else to say, but I feel like I should tell this guy something about myself.
He nods thoughtfully, and then speaks, "Tell me more about your relationship with your parents?"
Oh boy... Here we go again, I think to myself. I open up to him, telling him all about my childhood and growing up. He listens attentively, nodding along at times. It feels good to talk to somebody, even if they aren't a professional.
"Alice, do you have any siblings? What did you want to be when you grew up?"
I pause for a second, thinking about that. I had always wanted to work with animals, specifically horses. But my dad never let me near them when I was younger, and when I got older, I was too busy working and raising my own family. "I was gonna be a vet, I guess. I loved the idea of being able to help people. I just wish I'd gotten the chance to try and save my mom..."
Dr. Szozas stops me, and puts a comforting hand on my shoulder, "I understand. Tell me, are you seeing anyone in particular right now? A girlfriend perhaps? Boyfriend?"
I laugh nervously, and shake my head, "No, I'm not dating anybody at the moment. I was married once before, but the marriage didn't last. I'm still trying to figure out my feelings on the matter, and my life is pretty chaotic at the moment. I've only recently found out that I can use my abilities to help others, and I'm doing my best to put my life back together. I need to get my shit together first, though. I'm in therapy for the issue, and I'm
