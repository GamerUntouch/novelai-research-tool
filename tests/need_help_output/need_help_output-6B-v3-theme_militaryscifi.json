Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

I can tell by the slight widening of his pupils that he finds what he sees there very interesting. \"Well, let's start with 'why', shall we? Why do you want to know if you have any problems?\" he asks, and then adds, \"You seem perfectly healthy to me.\" He pauses for a moment, and lets out a breath before continuing, \"So why would you need a psychiatrist?\"\nI look at him quizzically, not sure where he is leading with this line of questioning. \"I don't understand,\" I say, a little confused now. \"Are you saying that I'm healthy?\"\n\"Yes, I am,\" he states firmly.\n\"Then what problem are you referring to?\" I ask, feeling a little frustrated with his answers.\n\"Sarah, I am a trained professional who specializes in the treatment of mental health issues,\" he explains patiently, \"and I am also a practicing psychologist.

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

Why are we here? And most importantly, what should I expect during our session together? But I don't know where to start.\nDr. Szozas smiles again, \"Do you feel alright, Kaitlyn? You seem a little anxious, perhaps nervous.\"\nYes, I am nervous, very nervous. My palms are sweating slightly, and I can barely keep myself still. This isn't normal behavior for me. \"Well, I guess I would say that I'm just generally stressed out right now.\"\nHe raises an eyebrow, \"You aren't normally nervous before seeing a therapist, are you?\"\nNo, not really, I'm more used to being the one asking for help than needing it.\nDr. Szozas pauses briefly, \"Ok then, let's talk about that. Do you mind if I call you by a nickname?\"\nA nickname? Oh god, please tell me there is a good reason for that request. \"Sure, go ahead. I'd prefer that to 'Miss' or anything else weird.\"\n\"Good girl!\" he responds with a smile, which makes me relax somewhat. He stands up from the chair and moves to the end table next to the couch, picking up his phone and punching a number into it. After a brief conversation, he returns to the sofa and sits back down.\n\"So, I've got a couple options for us today, but I think the best option is to try something called a Dialog Therapy Session.

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

What would I say if I were asked such questions about myself? \"It just seemed like a good place to go after college.\"\n\"What brought you to New York?\"\nHere goes... \"Well, I wanted to get out of Texas, actually.
