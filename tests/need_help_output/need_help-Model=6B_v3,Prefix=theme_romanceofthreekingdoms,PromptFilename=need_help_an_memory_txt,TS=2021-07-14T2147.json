He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",

My mind feels foggy all the time, I can't focus very well...\"\nSzozas listens intently, nodding occasionally.\n\"It started after I got back from my trip last month. It felt like there were things happening that weren't real to me, but I didn't know what they were or why they seemed unreal. Sometimes my head would feel heavy, and sometimes I'd get dizzy. I thought I was getting sick, but I wasn't sure. I went to the doctor, and she gave me some pills, which helped a little, but I still couldn't sleep. I was having trouble concentrating, and I was worried I was losing my memory. I was really scared; I didn't want to lose my memories of my family and friends, my work, my life. I was really afraid. I tried to talk to my boss, and I asked her for a leave, and she said I was not allowed to go on a vacation without permission. I was confused by this; I hadn't taken a vacation in years.\n\"I was also starting to think I should quit my job. I just wanted a break, and I needed some peace and quiet to figure out what I'm supposed to be doing with my life.

After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no.

Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

Any relationship difficulties or personal conflicts?\"\n\"Not really. It's more that I haven't slept very well the past couple nights.

  "prompt": "I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",
  "result": "My name is Lillian Chen.\"\nHe looks back at his computer screen, which shows a list of questions for me to answer. \"So, what do you want to talk about?\"\n\"Well, um, I have been having problems...\"\n\"What sort of problems? Tell me more.\"\n\"Well... I think there may be something wrong with me, but I don't know exactly what. I've had a few episodes where I seem to lose control of myself, and I just can't stop thinking about things. It's almost like I have a compulsion or an obsession. And I feel compelled to write things down. I find that if I start writing, I will never get anywhere until the thoughts are all out on paper. If I try to hold them in my head, they just won't go away. I don't understand this feeling.   I am afraid I might hurt people, because I cannot help myself.   I sometimes feel like I need help, and I really need to figure out a way to cope better, and maybe I should seek professional help.    Do you think I am crazy, Doctor?\"\nDr. Szozas smiles, \"No, I don't. I think you are experiencing a very common phenomenon, and I think we need to explore the issue further, so let's begin by asking a series of questions.\"\nI nod my assent.\n\"Why did you come to see me today?\"\nI pause for a moment, and then say, \"I came to see you for help in understanding my condition, and to ask for advice on how to deal with my problem. I was referred to you by a friend. \n\"OK, now, please tell me a little bit about yourself: What is your age? How long have you lived in China? Where were you born and raised? Who else lives in your household? Do you work outside of home? What type of job does",
