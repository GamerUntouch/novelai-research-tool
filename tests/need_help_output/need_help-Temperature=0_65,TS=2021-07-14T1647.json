Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

What does happen when you sleepwalk?\" He asks.\nI shake my head, \"No, nothing happens when I sleep walk. My brain just decides to move without any input from me.\" It sounds ridiculous even as I say it, and I can tell by his reaction that he thinks so too.\nHe ponders for a moment, then says, \"You mentioned in your message that you were having trouble sleeping. Do you have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep? Or waking up during the night?\"\n\"Yeah, usually I go right back to bed after getting out of the shower, but sometimes I'll wake up later than usual. The next morning, I feel groggy and tired all day long. And when I lie down at night, I always end up falling asleep before I should.\"\nHe smiles broadly at me now, \"Have you ever had problems with hallucinations or delusions? Any issues with anxiety or depression? Problems concentrating?\"\n\"Nope. I've never been sick, I'm pretty healthy,\" I answer honestly.\n\"What about other unusual behavior -- have you done anything strange that would stand out to others? Have there been changes in your diet? Alcohol use? Sleeping habits?\" He keeps asking questions until he finally gets an affirmative response -- \"No, no unusual behaviors, no change in diet, no alcohol -- no sleeping patterns that are different -- no.\"\nDr. Szozas looks at me thoughtfully, and leans forward on his chair. He holds his hand palm-up, \"Is there anything else that",

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

Why did I decide to seek help? What can this doctor tell me that I don't already know? Am I really crazy? Is there something wrong with me?\nDr. Szozas looks at me expectantly, patiently waiting for me to say more, but I just stare back at him silently. He sighs quietly, and puts his hands up, palms facing each other, \"OK, let's start again. Please state your full name for the record.\"\n\"Hannah Brown, Doctor.\"\n\"And what brings you here today?\"\nNow I have to answer. I should probably explain everything, right? But how much does he need to hear? It feels embarrassing talking about myself in front of someone else. Maybe I shouldn't even mention anything important, maybe I'll sound nuts if I talk too long about how I feel. Should I go straight to the point, or would it be better to give him an overview of my life first?\nBut before I get a chance to think any further, I blurt out, \"My husband left me last month.

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers.

Maybe I'll feel better after talking to somebody, maybe they'll have suggestions, or maybe they'll think I'm crazy... or both. Either way, I need help now.\nDr. Szozas nods, \"And how old are you?\" he asks next. I try to calculate what year it is.  It's been nearly two months since January 2nd, 2001. Two months ago was the day I woke up, disoriented and confused, still in bed. And now, today, July 16th, 2013, is the date on which I have an appointment with Doctor Michael Szosazs. Two months ago I wasn't sure if I'd ever wake up again. Now, however, I am starting to come back into focus.
