My name is Gwen. I'm twenty years old."č
He nods. "And why do we have you here today?"č
I exhale slowly, thinking hard, "Well, um... this isn't something that I want anyone else to know about..."
"That's fine by me," he assures me, smiling again. He sits back in his chair, leaning forward slightly, "Go ahead, tell me all about it."
So I start talking, telling him what happened last night, about the strange dreams, the images flashing through my mind, the odd sensations, the feelings, and then the weird feeling of wanting to touch myself while watching TV. It makes sense now that I think about it. The same sensation that happens when I watch porno movies or play with my own pussy.
When I get to the part where I masturbated, I stop, and feel embarrassed, "Oh, uhm... I guess I shouldn't say that too loudly."
Dr. Szozas laughs heartily, "No worries there! You can talk about whatever you'd like, and I won't judge. Just please don't use any names. And if you would just give me a brief synopsis, I'll be able to help you better."
I nod, and continue, "Um, well, after I finished with the masturbation session, I felt really good about it, but I was also a little disappointed because I didn't cum. So I decided to go to sleep, but the next morning I had the same exact dream about the same thing, except this time I woke up with a massive orgasm. I was shaking from head to toe, I couldn't move, I was so excited!"
"Hmm... That sounds a lot like a sexual arousal disorder," he muses.
"A-Sexual-Disorder? I've never heard that term before, but I'm sure it must be a type of mental illness, right?"

My name is Alice Cooper." I pause again, then continue, "I'm sorry, I don't know what else to say. I've never been diagnosed before this, and I don't have any idea what's happening to me. It's just... I feel different somehow, and I can't figure out what is causing it. And I need help."
He nods, "And why do you think that?"
"Well..." I begin, "It started last night after I looked through the web. I found a website called 'A Place Called Madness,' which had a lot of information on schizophrenia, and I found a description of symptoms similar to mine. The descriptions were very specific: the voices, hearing things that aren't there, seeing things that weren't there, losing touch with reality, paranoia, delusions, etc., etc. But the most interesting part was the section where they described the way people react when they hear the voices. They said that when the person hears a voice telling them to hurt themselves or others, they get scared and run away. This was exactly what happened to me yesterday. When I heard the voice telling me to kill myself, I ran away, and now I'm here."
Dr. Szozas responds with a smile, "Yes, I imagine that would be quite frightening for anyone to experience. Do you remember anything that the voice told you to do? Anything at all?"
"No, nothing. I tried talking back, but I didn't get a reply. I thought maybe I was imagining the whole thing, but I couldn't be sure. So I went to the library, but I still couldn't find out more about it. I was hoping that a book might shed light on the subject, but I only found one, a children's book about a boy who talks to a girl inside his head. I read that story, but I still wasn't sure if I should be taking medication to treat the problem."

My name is Rebecca Smith." I pause, feeling slightly embarrassed by my next words, "And I'm here because..." I trail off. What do I want? Why did I go through all this trouble to find Dr. Szosas? Well, the truth is, I don't know what I wanted. But I had to get help somehow. My mind is racing...
He smiles again, slowly, knowingly, and then asks, "Rebecca, would you say that you have been experiencing any changes since last week?" The question catches me completely by surprise, and I blurt out, "Yes!"
Dr. Szozas nods his head, saying, "OK, let's start there. Can you describe those changes?"
I can feel myself getting flustered, but I try to calm down and answer, "Well, um, yes ... I've become more aware of certain things, and less able to ignore them."
"What kinds of things?" He leans forward intently, waiting.
"Um, well, uh, the phone ringing when I'm not expecting it, or the sound of a car engine starting up in the middle of the night, and sometimes even people talking right outside my house," I admit hesitantly.
He looks at me, "How often does that happen?"
"It happened twice today, and once yesterday."
"Two times is a lot, isn't it?"
I nod, "Yeah, but I didn't think anything about it before. I just thought that maybe I was hearing things that weren't really there. But now I realize that I am perceiving something that I wasn't noticing before."
"Hmm, hmm, that is interesting. So, you were aware of the noise but ignored it until after the fact. That is a common symptom of auditory hallucinations, which is one type of hallucination. It is also a very common symptom of schizophrenia. Is that correct?"

My name is Stephanie A."
He nods, waiting for more information.
I continue, "And I'm here because... well, I think something very bad happened to me this weekend. I had been feeling strange all day Saturday, and then Sunday night, things got worse. And now they've gotten even weirder..."
"What do you mean 'strange?'" he asks, leaning forward.
"Well, after I went online last night, I started seeing images and videos, which were disturbing to say the least. The most recent one was the worst. It showed a woman being tortured by a group of men, and she was screaming. But I couldn't hear her screams, only their laughter. After watching that video, I decided I needed help. I don't know what's happening to me, but I'm afraid it may get worse if I wait any longer."
Dr. Szozas sits back up, and gives me a reassuring smile, "That was quite an ordeal to go through, and I can understand why you'd want to seek professional assistance. Please tell me about the other experiences."
"It wasn't just one experience. I saw a few different types of people doing horrible things to each other, including a couple of children. They weren't really kids; they looked older than me, maybe 20 or 21 years old. Some of the adults seemed to be raping women; I didn't actually witness that myself, but I heard them talking about it. I also watched a lot of pornography; I didn't recognize many of the actors or actresses, but there were a lot of female orgasms. I haven't seen that much porn since I left home to attend college, but I guess I missed a lot of good stuff. There was a video I kept replaying, but I'm not sure I would have recognized the actress without the title: Lesbian Gangbang. That was the first time I ever saw a lesbian gang bang;

My name is David Thomas." I pause again, unsure where to go next, then add, "and I've been having some... issues lately."
He nods, encouragingly. "What sort of 'issues'? What do you mean by 'lately'?" he asks.
I sigh, feeling embarrassed. "Well, uhm..." I stutter, "it all started after I came home from college last year. My parents were really worried about me. They thought I was depressed, or something, and they sent me to this shrink named Dr. Kowalski. She gave me pills that she said would help me sleep better, relax, blah blah blah."
Dr. Szozas raises an eyebrow, "And what did those pills have to say about her?"
I grimace, "She prescribed them because she wanted to get back together with my dad. It was just a ploy, but it worked for awhile. I went along with it, thinking that maybe things wouldn't work out between us, but they didn't, and I felt pretty bad about myself. I was ashamed to admit that I'd gotten involved with someone else, but it had happened anyway."
"So the drugs helped you feel better? You got more restful sleep?"
"Yeah, I guess. But then one day I woke up, and I wasn't sleepy anymore. I couldn't stop thinking about sex, about women, about everything. I felt horny all the time. I masturbated constantly, and I kept wondering about the girls I knew. I found a website called Chatroulette, and I spent hours there, watching videos with people that looked like me. I also watched a lot of porn. I tried to talk to a girl online once, but I chickened out. I'm not sure if I'm gay, bisexual, straight, or a little bit of both. I think I might be bi-curious. I don't know."

My name is Roberta." I pause again, and then add, "And I think something bad might have happened to me."č
He nods knowingly, and asks, "Can you tell me what brought you here?"
So I begin by telling him about the web site, and all the symptoms that had been plaguing me since Friday night, starting with the weird dreams and nightmares. I try to describe them as best I can, but they just don't seem real, even though I know that they were. The more I talk, the worse things get, until I finally cry. Tears run down my cheeks, and I feel helplessness wash over me. This is not right, this is not normal. It is too much, I cannot cope.
Dr. Szozas looks at me sympathetically, "Roberta, you sound very stressed out, do you want to take a short break? You may need to calm down before we continue."
No! No way, I will NOT stop talking now. If anything, I'm getting angrier, because I'm scared. Scared that I've lost control, scared that I'll never be able to explain what is happening to me.
He continues, "Take a deep breath, count slowly to ten, and let it out. That's good, now go ahead, please continue."
It is hard to breathe, to speak, I am hyperventilating, but I manage to say, "Ok, I'm ready to resume."
"Well, I am happy to hear that you are willing to discuss this with me. Now, I'd like to ask you some questions, and I'd like to conduct an examination if that is acceptable to you."
This is the last thing I wanted to happen, but I nod anyway.
"Do you mind if I use a tape recorder?"
Again, I shake my head "no".
"Good. I am going to

My name is Mabel Lyle."
He nods, "And tell me about yourself?"
So I start talking, telling him all about myself: My parents were both doctors (my mother was a surgeon), and they died when I was young. I never knew them very much because we lived far away from each other. But I had a brother named Paul, who was older than me by two years. We grew up together, and then after high school, I went off to college while he stayed home. I met my husband there, and married him shortly before our son was born. Our marriage didn't last long after the birth, and my husband left soon thereafter, taking our child with him. I haven't seen either one since.
Dr. Szozas listens intently to my story, nodding occasionally, asking questions when necessary. When I finish, he asks me, "Would you describe what happened next? How did things go wrong for you?"
I pause, and think about this question. It is not easy to explain something like this without sounding crazy or delusional. I have been trying hard to find the words that will do justice to what I experienced, and I can't seem to come up with anything good enough to convey the experience to another person. I'm sure I'll be able to tell others about the details later when I feel more composed, but right now I'm just a little overwhelmed.
"Well, I guess the best way to put it is that I started having visions. Visions that I couldn't control, that would happen suddenly, sometimes even when I wasn't thinking about it. I'd be sitting at work, reading a book, and I'd look up at the clock, and it would say 7:30pm, and I'd get that feeling of dread, that 'something bad is going to happen' sensation. I'd be driving, listening to music, and I'd look at the radio dial, and I

My name is Susan James."
He nods slightly, encouraging me to continue.
"Well, uhm... I've been having trouble sleeping lately. And then there were dreams..." I pause, trying to remember them all now, "and they seem to be getting worse."
"What sort of dreams?" he asks calmly.
I swallow hard, and try to answer honestly, "Mostly sexual ones."
Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair, crossing one leg over the other, and steepling his hands together, "And what do those consist of? What have you dreamed about?"
I feel myself blush, "Uhm... well... mostly just sex acts between men. But sometimes women too. Sometimes with animals. Or aliens. Or both. It's really confusing."
Dr. Szozas continues to stare intently at me, "Do you recall anything specific about any of the scenes, or people involved?"
"No. They just seemed very vivid to me. Like I was right there watching it happen."
"Have you ever experienced something similar before?"
"Not exactly. I don't know if this is normal, but I also had the same dream last night that I did the night before that. I think I'm starting to get a pattern. I'm pretty sure that I'm not imagining things."
"That does sound like a recurring theme. Do you mind telling me about the details of the first dream?"
So I tell him about the first dream, which is the most recent one I can remember, but I'm not sure I'm being completely honest with him. I'm wondering about the second part of the dream, where I'm feeling pain from the inside out, but I'm not entirely sure how to bring that up.
But Dr. Szozas doesn't press me about that particular scene; instead he leans forward, "Susan, I'd like to ask you a few questions about

My name is Annabelle Smith."č
He nods his head slightly, then looks back up at me, "And why did you contact me?"č
I pause again, thinking hard. I want this guy to understand me, to know what's happening inside my mind, but I also don't want to sound crazy. And I can't tell him because I don't even really know myself yet. It's like being lost in a dark forest, where there are all sorts of sounds and smells, but nothing is clear or distinct. All I have are questions. What if he thinks I'm crazy? Or worse, what if he doesn't think I'm crazy, but just wants to help? I feel overwhelmed by the thought of telling him anything about myself.
Then I hear something: a whisper. A soft voice, almost too low to be heard, whispers into my ear, "You need to trust me." The voice is gentle, but firm. "Trust me, and let go of your fear."
I turn my head slowly towards the source of the voice, and find myself staring into those beautiful brown eyes that seem to peer right through me. The intensity of their gaze makes my heart skip a beat, and I realize that I am completely captivated by his stare. My mouth goes dry, and I can't move or speak, but I'm not sure whether I should.
The man leans forward, his face inches from mine, and he speaks, "Let me show you, Annabelle. I promise you will be okay."
He leans closer still, until our foreheads touch, and I gasp. His lips are soft, warm, and they brush against my cheek softly. I'm paralyzed with shock; I've never been kissed before!
Dr. Szozas pulls away, his breath tickling my neck. I'm dazed; I didn't expect that kiss to be quite so passionate or intimate. I am suddenly aware

My name is Samantha Adams." The room grows silent, except for the faint sound of water trickling in a nearby sink. My heart beats fast, I feel dizzy, and I try to speak again, "Um... I..." But before I can say anything else, Dr. Szozas holds up one finger, silencing me. He leans forward, placing his elbows onto his knees, and then looks directly into my eyes, saying softly, "Tell me about Sam."
So I tell him all about Sam: her birth, where she grew up, her family, her friends, what makes her tick. And I talk about Sam's problems, which seem to include having trouble making decisions, being indecisive, not knowing whether she likes people or not, feeling uneasy when she is alone, wondering if she will ever find a partner, etcetera, etcetera. As I do this, I realize that Dr. Szozas is listening intently, taking notes, nodding his head occasionally when something rings true. After I finish talking, he asks questions about myself, such as 'Do you have any brothers?' and 'Have you ever had an eating disorder?', to which I answer yes to both.
He stops writing long enough to ask me a question, "Samantha, would you describe a typical day in the life of Sam?"
"Well, um, I don't know exactly. It varies a lot, but I guess I'd wake up early, maybe go to school, eat lunch with a friend, come home, study a little bit more, hang out with a few friends until late evening, come back home, maybe watch a movie, sleep a couple hours, get up, repeat the whole thing the next day. Oh yeah, sometimes I'll be up later than usual because I stayed up too late the night before, but usually that doesn't happen very often."
"How does that compare to your own days growing up
