=== Prompt ========================================
I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
[Period: Modern Day]
[Year: 2020 AD]
[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "


=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Emerald Bierce."   My mother named me after her grandmother, she was called Emery. She died when I was five years old.
He nods, and then asks, "What do you want to talk about?"
I start talking, trying to organize my thoughts. My story starts by telling him that I've been having problems since I was very young. I think it started when I was four or five, but I can't really remember. 
I tell him that I have trouble sleeping, nightmares mostly, and that I get depressed when things don't go my way. Sometimes I feel like crying, but other times I just feel angry. I also say that sometimes I feel scared or anxious, and that I often lose my temper.
Dr. Szozas listens intently, and writes notes on a pad of paper. I continue, "Sometimes I hear voices, and I have dreams where I'm being chased, and I try to run away, and I end up in a dark room, a scary place. I never know what will happen next, and I wake up feeling terrified and confused. I need help, I need advice. I need to know what to do, and I don't know if I should keep doing this, I'm afraid to stop. I'm not sure if I'm crazy, and I'm not sure if I'll ever be normal. I need help!"
I cry, and I shake, and I ask for his help. He looks at me, and his eyes are kind, and I sense compassion. He tells me that I seem like a good kid, and that I deserve a chance. He tells me that I am not crazy, and that I shouldn't let anyone else decide what I am. He gives me hope, and I feel better, and I thank him for his time.
I leave his office feeling a little more hopeful, and I walk out into the sunshine.

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Baret Sterling."   I pause again, thinking about what else I should say, but then I realize I have nothing more to add.
He looks back at me, "And?"
I clear my throat, "Barrett Sterling. I've been having problems lately. I feel... uncomfortable.   I don't know what to do, I can't seem to get any help anywhere."
Dr. Szozas nods slowly, "Do you want to talk about those issues? You may not even be aware of them yet. Or maybe there are things that happened recently that led up to this issue, or perhaps something that happened before we met. How did you find me?"
I shrug, "Well, I was surfing the web for a therapist, and I came across your website. It said that you specialize in unusual cases, and I thought that might apply to me."
Dr. Szozas smiles at me, "It does, but let's start at the beginning, shall we?" He pauses, and then continues, "Tell me when you were born and where, and tell me how old you are now, and when you last had a physical examination, and when the most recent one took place. I'll need to review the medical records to determine if I'm able to treat you. If I determine that I cannot, I will refer you to another counselor, but I would prefer to try to work through the issues at hand first. I'm also going to need to ask you a few personal questions, and I hope you won't mind answering them honestly. I'm sure you're a very private person, and I respect that. I promise I won't use anything you say against you in our sessions, and I will keep all the information I learn strictly confidential. I am a professional, and I must adhere to the rules and regulations set forth by my licensing board. I'm a psychiatrist, and I'm licensed to

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Baret Ellington, and I came because I have been experiencing...unusual symptoms."
He nods encouragingly, and leans forward slightly, "Tell me about those symptoms?"
"Well, uh..." My face flushes red, I feel awkward, but I continue, "I've been having weird dreams, where I think there is something wrong with me, but I can't tell what exactly. I keep thinking about suicide, and I can't seem to stop myself from wanting to do it. But then, other times, I want to kill everyone else, which makes me feel sick inside, and even more depressed than before. It's really hard for me to get out of bed, or go anywhere without feeling awful and miserable. And sometimes I just don't know if I should live anymore."
Dr. Szozas sits back, and looks at me for a moment, and then asks quietly, "Have you ever felt this way before? Do you remember any previous episodes in life, when you were suicidal, or violent, or anything similar?"
I shake my head, "No, I guess not. I'm not sure I would recognize the signs if I had. When I was younger, I did try to commit suicide, a couple of years ago, when I was in high school. I was a pretty good athlete, and I was in the track team. I was running in a race when I slipped and fell in the mud, and I got a concussion. I was out for a few weeks, and I thought I'd never be able to run again, and I was convinced that I didn't deserve to. I wanted to die, and I knew that I was going to. So I went to a friend's house and I took a bunch of pills. I wasn't sure if I was taking the right ones, and I drank some beer and vodka too. I passed out in the bathtub, and when I woke

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Baret Youngblood, and I've been having issues since I was twelve years old." I pause, then continue, "When I was thirteen, I had a very bad experience with a girl named Ashley, and ever since that time, I have not felt good about myself...not even close.  It started when she broke up with me, but I think part of the problem was the fact that we were dating each other, and I knew deep inside that I wasn't her type. She was too skinny, not strong enough for me, and not athletic enough for me either. But I still liked her, and I wanted her to like me back. I would do anything for her, and I tried hard to impress her with my 'nice guy' persona.
I never got the chance to tell her what I really thought because I didn't know what I really thought. I just acted nice and sweet and I did my best to get along with everyone else, but I couldn't stand the way I treated her. I always made fun of her, I made jokes at her expense, and I pushed her away. I hated myself for doing that, and I hated her for making me feel that way. I couldn't believe that I was treating her that badly, and I wished I hadn't done that.
I don't remember what happened after that, but I woke up the next morning, and I realized that I loved my mother more than I'd ever loved anyone before. I fell in love with my mom, and I wanted to be the perfect son for her. I wanted to make my mom proud of me. I learned that I could be a better person, and I decided to change my life for the better. I made a lot of mistakes, and I'm sure that I'll make a few more, but I'm going to keep trying.
I want to thank you for taking the time out to meet with me today. I

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Baret."
He nods, then asks, "What brings you to see me?"
I tell him about my relationship problems. He listens attentively, nodding along while I speak, but he never interrupts, just letting me talk, until finally I get to the end of my story.
"So, this is all new to me. What do you think? Should we meet again?"
"Absolutely. We should definitely continue our sessions together. It would help us both immensely.  In fact, I have another session scheduled for Wednesday at 1pm. If that works for you, please let me know. I'll email you the details. You can also call my office if you'd prefer."
Dr. Szozas looks at me with those wonderful eyes, and I feel myself flush, and I nod, "Yes, I will. Thank you for being willing to listen to me."
He smiles at me and stands up, "You are very welcome. I hope I was helpful. Do give me a call next week, and I'll schedule the follow-up appointment for you. I really enjoyed meeting you, and I look forward to working with you. Have a good day!"
And I leave his office.
That was amazing! I didn't expect anything like that at all. I was expecting a boring appointment, and I got something totally unexpected.
I wonder what else I might find out.
I'm not sure whether or not I want to go back.
I decide to go for a walk in the park.
I need to clear my head.
I stop by a bookstore, and pick up a book on the history of psychiatry and psychology, and I start reading.
I've read a lot of books on the subject, and I don't really understand much. I'm pretty sure I learned in school, but I'm not a hundred percent certain. The more I learn, though, the less confused

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Baret Kertesz."   I pause, and then continue, "and I think that there may be something wrong with me. My problem is that I have been seeing things that aren't real, but they feel very real, and I can't explain them logically or rationally. They seem like memories of another life, a past life...or maybe a future one?"
He nods, "Go ahead..."
"Well, I've had a recurring dream since I was about 10 years old where I'm floating above the ground, watching myself walking along the streets below, and all sorts of people pass by me. It's always the same street, and I don't know what city or country this is.  In the dream, I watch myself walk down the sidewalk, and I hear the sounds of traffic passing, cars honking, and the occasional huffing sound of a truck engine. I also smell exhaust fumes, and I smell burning oil and gasoline. The only other thing I ever see is a park bench. I remember that I used to spend a lot of time sitting on that park bench when I lived in a small town in Nebraska. I would stare at the sky, and I watched the clouds go by for hours. I even saw a meteor shower once, when I was a kid.
I never knew my parents, and I grew up in an orphanage. I went to school, I graduated, and I got a job. I worked for a few different companies, and I saved my money. I wanted to travel, and I did. I moved around a lot, and I met a girl. We fell in love, and we were happy together for a while. I quit my job and I took her to a nice hotel in New York City, and we spent our first night in a bed. She looked at me, and she said, "You are my everything, you will be my husband and my lover

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My full name is Baret Daughtrey, and I've been seeing Dr. Szozas about an issue that I have."
He nods slowly, "And what might this 'issue' be?"
Well, um...   I feel guilty, but I can't help myself. I know I should just tell the truth, but I don't want to disappoint him, or let him think less of me, so I try to figure out a way to phrase things to sound better than they actually were. I decide that maybe I can just say the most important part, and then leave out the rest.
So I start talking, and when I get to the part where I talk about my sex life with my husband, I stop. I freeze up, because I realize that I'm blushing furiously, and I'm not sure if I was right to bring up the subject. I look away, embarrassed, "Um..."
Dr. Szozas smiles at me reassuringly, "You don't need to go any further if you don't wish to, I promise not to judge or criticize. You are free to skip ahead to the next section if you need to. Just keep in mind, there is no shame in being honest, and if anything, I'd appreciate if you would share with me the details of the situation, and I'll do the same. I will not pry, nor will I condemn, and I will not judge. I am a trained professional, and I understand confidentiality. I hope we can work together to find a solution to whatever problem you may have."
I nod, still feeling uncomfortable, but I begin again, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to, uh, I shouldn't have brought up my, ah, my relationship with my husband. I'm having a hard time figuring out, well, I guess the best way to put it is I'm confused by my feelings for my husband. I love my

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Emerald Breethington." I pause, unsure what else to say, but I feel compelled to continue. "I've been having problems... issues..." I stutter nervously.
He nods encouragingly, "Yes? Please go ahead."
So I begin, "Well, um, I have this problem where I can't seem to control my urges. I want things, but then I don't know what they are until later. It makes me frustrated, angry, confused. I think about sex all day long, and I just need release sometimes. But when I try to do anything, it doesn't work out right. Sometimes I end up being punished by the person I'm attracted to." I pause, waiting for his reaction.
Dr. Szozas listens intently, and his face shows a slight grimace, "Oh dear, I'm sorry to hear that. What is the last time that happened?"
I shake my head, "It wasn't really the last time, I guess. I was getting ready for school one morning, and I went into the bathroom and took off my panties and bra, and I was masturbating. I was thinking about my boyfriend at the time, and I started imagining him doing naughty things to me, and I felt really good while I was touching myself. Then I heard my mom calling my name downstairs, and I put my clothes back on, and I ran out of the room to answer the phone. When I got downstairs, my dad was there and my mom was saying, 'Emerald, I'm going to pick up the kids, I'll be home in a few hours. I hope you had fun at the beach, bye!' and she left. I was so mad, and I wanted to get even more. So I did something I shouldn't have done, and I fucked my boyfriend's best friend in the bedroom. I tried to hide it, and I didn't tell anyone,

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Baret Youngblood."   I pause, waiting for him to ask me more about myself, but instead he just nods thoughtfully.
He continues, "Tell me, Mr. Youngblood, what do you think makes a person happy?"   I shrug, unsure of where this is headed. He gives me a gentle smile, then asks again, "What does happiness mean to you? What would make you feel happier than anything else?"
I consider his question carefully before responding, "Well, I guess... if everyone was happy, then life would be perfect. It sounds silly, but there isn't any other answer that I can give right now..."
Dr. Szozas chuckles, "That's a good start, young man. You don't have to worry about being ridiculous or making a fool of yourself. Please continue, tell me what you know about yourself, and how you've been feeling lately."
I ponder his words, and I say, "OK, I'll try my best. I'm 25 years old, and I live alone in a small apartment building in the city. I work at a computer company, and I get along well with my co-workers. I enjoy my job, and I'm doing pretty well financially. I go out to dinner and movies occasionally, and I'm trying to meet new people. I also play guitar, and I'm learning a lot from my teacher. I'm not sure, though, if I'm really meeting anyone, or if I'm spending too much time on my own.
I sigh, "I'm not getting anywhere with the woman I'm dating. We haven't had sex for three months, and I keep thinking she wants to break up with me. I want her to stay, I really do, and I'm starting to wonder if I should find another girlfriend. I'm having trouble sleeping, and I wake up at night often. The last few days,

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My full name is Baret Keith Etington." I pause, and then continue, "Well, actually my real name is Bartlett, but everyone calls me Baret because they think I sound cool, which I don't mind at all."   I smile at him, hoping that this will alleviate any concerns.
He smiles back, but doesn't say anything right away, instead just staring at me intently. I feel uncomfortable, almost like he can read my thoughts somehow. I clear my throat, "So... what do you want to know?"
"Bartlett..." he starts slowly, and pauses for a moment before continuing, "...tell me about your relationship with your father."
I stare at the carpeted floor for a long time, thinking. I try to remember things I've heard my parents talk about, and I decide to start there. I begin, "When I was a kid, I was a lot more interested in my dad than I was my mom. I liked the stories that my dad used to tell, and I would listen to them while I was working on my homework or reading a book. My dad was a pretty good storyteller, and I loved hearing his voice. I thought I'd never get tired of listening to his voice.
I recall one particular evening when my dad was telling a particularly interesting tale, and I was getting sleepy. I yawned and stretched my arms, and I said, "Dad, I'm tired, I should go to bed now. Goodnight, Dad.
I leaned forward and kissed his cheek, and I got up from the chair. I was halfway to my bedroom when my dad called out to me, "Wait!"
I turned around, and my dad was standing in the doorway, smiling, "You were really into the story tonight. I have a question for you, though. Do you think that I'm an amazing person, or a horrible person, based on the
