=== Prompt ========================================
I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.

[Year: 2020 AD]
[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "


=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Sarah Moore, and I came because I had been experiencing strange feelings since about last month."
He nods, and then continues, "You say strange feelings? What sort of feelings?" 
I tell him all about my feelings, and he listens intently, nodding occasionally, asking questions, and making suggestions. It's fascinating to listen to his responses, his tone of voice changes as he speaks, his body language shifts, his facial expressions change, and I feel myself growing more relaxed. The whole process is quite stimulating, and I find myself wanting to ask him personal questions.
I don't know what prompted me to do this, but I begin by asking, "Do you think there is something wrong with me?"
Dr. Szozas smiles, and shakes his head, "No, not at all. Your problem is very common, and I've seen many people in the past few years, just like you, who have experienced similar feelings. We call them 'the dark side.'"
I nod, and I smile, feeling a little better now, "So I'm not crazy or anything?"
He laughs, "Oh, no, not at all! You are absolutely normal, healthy young woman, and I would never suggest otherwise. In fact, we can use the term 'normal' rather loosely in the case of you, Sarah Moore. I'd even go so far as to say that you are a little unique. But, I'm not sure I understand, and I'm a little confused, so I want to hear the story from the beginning. How did you first start to experience these...dark feelings?"
I answer, "Well, I was working on a project, and I started to get the sense that I wasn't alone. I was thinking of my work colleagues, and I began to wonder if they were having a good time at the party. I couldn't help wondering, and my mind wandered to the other attendees,

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Katherine Mary Smith, and I'm here because I think I might have become addicted to sex."
He looks at me quizzically, and then responds, "Have you ever heard of kinky sex?"
I shake my head yes, and say, "Kinky? What does that mean exactly?"
He answers, "It means that there are certain sexual acts that people do which are considered 'kinky.' For example, anal sex, oral sex, or even role playing, such as being a dominatrix or submissive. Do you know anything about those activities?"
I answer, "No, I don't really know much about them, but I've been having fantasies about things like that lately. It's driving me crazy, and I feel like I need help. I can't sleep at night, and I'm not sure what this is all about..."
He smiles again at me, and I smile back at him, and I sense that I am making a connection with him. He asks, "Do you want to tell me more about what you're experiencing now?"
I begin, "I was watching a movie last week, and I noticed something. I was fantasizing about a scene in the film, where the male lead was fucking a woman in the ass. I was thinking to myself, “That would be hot.” I got horny, and I masturbated to the thought. I didn't actually watch the whole thing, I just wanted to get off. I was aroused by the idea, and I couldn't stop thinking about it for days afterwards. I started to wonder if I had a problem. I was thinking to myself, I should probably talk to somebody about this. I looked online for a counselor, and I found a website, and I sent an email to the address they gave me. I never expected to hear from Dr. Michael Szozas, and I was surprised when he responded to my email

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Mary Jane Watson."   I pause, then add, "And I don't know what's happening to me."
He nods, slowly, and asks, "What do you remember?"
“Nothing really. It's just sort of like waking up one day and feeling different. A little weird? Confused? Not knowing what's real or not? And all this time I thought I had a boyfriend named Peter Parker. But now I think I might have been dating Spiderman instead. That would explain the feelings.”
Dr. Szozas sits back and ponders my words for a moment, and then responds, “It sounds to me like you've had an experience that was somewhat traumatic, but not too bad. Are there any other details you can recall, or anything else that may help us understand the situation better?”
I shake my head, and I say, "No, nothing. I'm sorry I didn't tell anyone about my problems. I guess I was afraid they'd laugh at me or something. I was scared. I never wanted to hurt anybody, and I want things to go back to normal again. I need help. I hope I'll feel better soon. I need a good night sleep. I need to get my life together. I need... I..."
I stop talking because I realize I am crying, tears rolling down my cheeks. I wipe my eyes, and I turn away from the doctor, embarrassed, ashamed, confused, frustrated, and I ask, "Why did I come here today? Why did I even come at all? I'm supposed to be seeing a counselor, and yet I came here to cry! I'm such a mess!"
The doctor gets up out of his chair, and he walks around his desk and approaches me. He crouches beside the couch and offers his hand to help pull me to my feet. I look at

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Darlene Blythe." I pause there, and then continue, "Well, my real name is Delores Blaine, but I changed my last name after I got married. My husband didn't want to change his surname, though, so we just kept mine. But I don't really know what else to say other than 'Darlene Blythe.'"
He nods, and looks at me intently. "OK, tell me about this issue you have."
I begin to explain, “It started two years ago when I was pregnant. It all happened very suddenly...”
* * *
And so I began telling my story. I described the strange changes I had been experiencing since getting pregnant, and I explained that my breasts were growing, and they became increasingly sore. I also mentioned the strange swelling of my abdomen, which caused me discomfort. And my nipples grew larger and more sensitive, and my sex drive increased dramatically.
Dr. Szozas listened attentively, nodding his head in understanding. At times I would stop talking for a moment, as if I was gathering my thoughts. He gave me a few moments to collect myself, and I did.
Then I continued. I told him about the dreams I'd been having, and I talked to him about my fears. I told him how I felt when I woke up each morning, wondering if I should go to work or stay home. I told him how my body ached when I went on a run, or when I worked out at the gym.
I was a little embarrassed, but I knew I needed to share these things with him, and I hoped I wasn't being too personal. I wanted to be honest and open, because I trusted him.
Dr. Szozas nodded and asked questions when I paused for a breath or thought. I answered his queries, and I told him everything that was bothering me.
Finally, I

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Emily Lefebvre."
He nods, and then smiles again. “And why are you here?”
So many reasons came to mind, but I choose one at random, "Because I have a problem."
“What sort of problem do you have, Miss... ?"
I feel myself blush, and I respond, "It's a sexual problem, Doctor."
Now his smile widens, and he leans forward in his chair, asking, "Can you tell me what that means?"
I glance at the clock on his wall, which reads 9:15am, "Well, there's this guy named Gary, and we've been seeing each other for a few weeks now, and I think he might be gay, and..."
Dr. Szozas interrupts, "Hmmm, so, you believe that Gary is homosexual, and yet you still want to continue dating him?"
I nod, "Yes."
"Why is that, Miss Lefebvre?"
I explain, "I don't know, I just can't stop thinking about sex, and I guess I'm confused because I'm attracted to men, and I really like being touched by them, but I also get aroused when I hear them talk dirty, or when they say things to me, or when I watch porn, or when I read stories online, and I'm really horny all the time, and I'm not sure if I should tell Gary the truth, or if I should pretend I'm straight, and I'm afraid of hurting his feelings, and I'm worried I'll lose his friendship, and I'm not even sure if I'm a lesbian, and I'm having trouble figuring out what to do, and I'm feeling very conflicted right now, and I need help!"
Dr. Szozas responds, "Miss Lefebvre, I see. Let

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Lillian Jenson, and I've been having problems." My voice sounds shaky to me, but I can hear myself speak clearly enough. It doesn't seem real. This is all too surreal. How did I get here? Am I dreaming?
Dr. Szozas leans back in his chair, crossing one leg over the other, and he smiles kindly at me, "What sort of 'problems', Miss Jenson?"
I tell him about the dreams that I have had since last night. The dream where the doctor was there for me, and helped me through my problem. And then another dream, where I woke up this morning, feeling guilty and ashamed because I didn't go to work yesterday. I feel terrible now, but I know that if I hadn’t slept at home, I would have gotten up sick and missed my job.
Dr. Szozas listens carefully, and when I finish, he sits forward in his chair and looks at me intently, "And what do you think the cause might be for the guilt and shame you felt after missing your shift yesterday?"
I try to answer, "Well... I don't really know. I guess I just thought I should be at work. I felt bad for not showing up. I never miss a day, and I always call in when I'm ill, and I'm usually able to explain the situation, and they understand. But I really wasn't feeling well, and I couldn't afford to lose my job. I knew I'd have to pay for my medicine, and I still need the money for the rent. I'll be okay, I'm sure."
Dr. Szozas nods, and he responds, "Miss Jenson, I want to assure you, you are not at fault for anything. You are a good person, and you were trying to help yourself out, and to help others. That is what makes us human; our ability

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Sarah Smith."
"Sarah, tell me about this issue that you have been having?" he asks.  He speaks slowly, calmly, and his face remains expressionless, but I can sense his curiosity about my problem. I continue talking, telling him about my strange feelings, my inability to sleep, the panic attacks, and all the other symptoms associated with insomnia. I also explain that I had to go back to bed after only two hours, and now I've got a headache and I feel very tired. 
Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding occasionally, asking questions, making suggestions. He looks at me, then looks away again. I get the impression that he is thinking deeply about something. Finally he stands up and gestures to me to follow him to the kitchen. I walk into the kitchen and he pulls out a chair for me, and I sit down at the table.
"Tell me more about what's happening to you, and what you think is causing it," he prompts.
I begin to talk, describing the fear, the anxiety, the lack of energy, the feeling of being trapped, the headaches, and the nightmares.
"Do you know what dreams are?” he inquires.
I shake my head.
"They're a part of our subconscious mind. It's where we store things, like memories, fears, desires, and fantasies. We may not remember them consciously, but they still exist in the recesses of our minds. Dreams often contain images, symbols, or emotions, and when those elements come together in the right way, the result is a dream message," he explains.
I nod my understanding, but I don't really understand, and I'm beginning to wonder if I should leave.
"Sarah, I want to try and help you, and I need to do some tests, to find out exactly what's going on in your brain," he tells me.


=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Sarah Smith. It’s been two years since I've had any contact with my family. My parents passed away within months of each other, and I have no idea where they are buried. They were never married, but I have a brother, David, who is also deceased.  He was killed by a drunk driver back in 2015." I pause, and then continue, "In 2016, I moved to San Francisco to live near my best friend, Samantha. We both work at a small coffee shop called “Penny Lane". I was hired on as the assistant manager, and she became one of our baristas. I got along really well with her, until last week..."
I stop myself, and feel tears building up in my eyes, and I turn to face the wall. I hear Dr. Szozas murmur, "Sarah?"
I nod my head yes, and I say, "Yes, I want to get help... I don't know what I should do, or what to expect, or if I can trust anyone, or if I'll ever find my way out of this mess I'm in. I need help, and I hope that I can trust you, Dr. Michael Szozas, and I think I will. I just need to figure out what to tell you about my situation. I'd rather not talk about my dead relatives or my old life in Detroit, I guess I'm feeling vulnerable, and I'm afraid to open up and let you in. I'm sorry, I'm rambling. What I'm trying to say is that I'm very confused, and I'm scared, and I just need a little help figuring out how I'm supposed to go on from here. I appreciate the offer to come in for a consultation, and I accept it gratefully, but I'm not sure if I can afford to pay you for your time."
I am surprised at my own words,

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Rachel Matson. My boyfriend dumped me yesterday, because I said I wanted to break up."
He looks surprised, then concerned, and asks, "What happened?"
 
Well, let's just say that I've been having problems lately, and I don't know if they are normal, but I can't talk to anyone about them without crying, and I don't want to cry anymore. But I have to tell somebody, and I think that maybe this will help? I feel better already.
Dr. Szozas pauses for a moment, and nods his head, “That's very understandable,” he responds.  
He continues, "Rachel, I understand what you're saying. It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure right now, and I'd like to get a little more information before we proceed any further. Would you mind telling me a little bit about your life?"
I do, and I explain my situation to him, and the events leading up to the breakup, and I start to tear up again.
Dr. Szozas gets up and goes to his desk, and returns to his chair, and sits beside me. "I'll need a few minutes, and I may need to ask a few questions. Please try not to worry, I promise I won't keep you long," and his voice is reassuring and comforting.
I begin talking, and I share my story with him, starting from the beginning, my childhood, and the school I attended, and the friends I had there. I describe my relationship with my parents, and the challenges I faced growing up. I also described my time at the University, and my first year there.
I talked about my work at the bank, my boss, and my coworkers. I told him that I was happy in my job and enjoyed working for the company, and that I felt appreciated by my colleagues, even though my superiors were

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Mary Ellen Smith."
He nods. “And what brings you here today?”
I pause again. “Well, I've been experiencing certain... uh... feelings lately, and I thought maybe I should talk to someone about them. And I found this website where people can get advice. It said to email you.”
He smiles at me, and then looks off, pondering something. I wonder what is happening inside his head right now. What is he thinking?
After a minute or two, he turns back to face me, and asks softly, "So tell me more about those 'feelings'."
I sigh, and say, "It's hard to explain. But I think they might be related to my job. Or rather, my lack thereof. I have a great position at a very high salary at a major company, but I don't feel fulfilled. I know there are other things I want to do, but I'm stuck in a rut. I feel trapped by my career, and I don't know what I want to do next. I just wish I felt better. I feel like I'm missing out on life. I'm not sure if I'm depressed, but I'm definitely not happy. I'm not sure if I need therapy, but I'm not sure if I shouldn't. I'm not sure if I should seek counseling, and I'm not sure if I'll ever find the answer. I guess I'm just wondering if I'm crazy. I really need help. I hope I haven't made a mistake in coming here. I'd hate for my family to worry about me."
Dr. Szozas listens intently, and he nods at my responses. He gives a slight smile, and says, "I understand, and I believe I may be able to help. Tell me, does anything come to mind when I ask you that question?"
I think for a
