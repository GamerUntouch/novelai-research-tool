He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",
  "result": "My name is Kirito.\" \nHe nods, satisfied, then asks, \"And what brings you to see me today?\"\nIt's hard to explain what brought me there, because I don't know myself. I just feel that something is wrong, and I want help. I can't describe what exactly this feeling is...but I've had it for months now. It started during middle school, when I was struggling with my grades. My parents were really worried about me, but they couldn't do anything to improve my academic performance. And after all, I wasn't doing badly in sports or any other extracurricular activities, either. They suggested that maybe I was having trouble concentrating, or getting enough sleep. But I didn't have a problem sleeping; sometimes I even stayed up late playing video games.\nI decided to visit a psychologist to try and figure out the source of my problems, but the person I saw turned out to be a fraud. I got a letter back saying I'd been referred by the police department, which I thought was a joke at first. I went to the police station to get more information, only to find out that the letter came from the city hall, not the police.\nI tried a few different psychologists, but none of them helped me. I kept thinking, \"Maybe I should go to a psychiatrist instead...\" I searched the web for a recommendation, and finally found a Dr. Szozas' website. I emailed him, and made an appointment for Monday at 9am.\nBut I still haven't figured out the reason for my issues. I'm not sure if I need therapy, or a prescription for medication, or both. I guess I'll ask the doctor at my appointment.\nDr. Szozas smiles at me again, and looks deep into my eyes. \"Tell me, Mr. Kazuto, did the counselor you visited give you a diagnosis? What sort of treatment plan does he recommend",

  "prompt": "I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",
  "result": "My name is Alice.\"\nHe smiles again, and asks, \"And where do you live?\"\n\"In District 1 of New York City,\" I answer honestly.\nHe nods, and continues, \"What brings you to this clinic today? Is there anything specific that concerns you right now?\"\nI pause, and think about what I want to say. \"Well... I've been feeling off lately. My moods swing all over the place, and I can't seem to settle down. Sometimes I feel fine, other times I just don't know if I should be happy or sad. It makes me worry for myself and others, but...\" I trail off, unsure of what else to tell him.\nDr. Szozas chuckles softly, and responds, \"That sounds very familiar. You may have had an episode of bipolar disorder, which is a common affliction among people in your age group. I'd recommend seeing a psychiatrist for treatment, and maybe getting a prescription for an anti-depressant, depending on the severity.   I'll need a few days to prepare a file for the insurance company, and we'll need to schedule a follow-up appointment to review progress. I'm sure that the insurance will cover the visit.\"\nI nod my head, and smile. \"Oh, that would be great. I'm really struggling with depression, and I was thinking I might need a stronger medication than I already am on. I was hoping to get a referral to a psychiatrist in the city, but I wasn't sure how I'd find one. I figured that I'd try to go to the local clinics first, and then see if I could track them down through the internet. But I never expected to meet a real person in the flesh. I guess I'm a little nervous. I haven't seen a doctor in years, and I'm not even sure how they work.\"\nThe counselor smiles, and pats his lap. \"",
