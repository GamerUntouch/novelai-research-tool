He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

I wonder if they'll get married soon? I hope so. She deserves happiness.\nDr. Szozas nods sympathetically, \"That sounds like a symptom of depression, which is quite common among young adults nowadays. What do you think caused the depressive symptoms to manifest themselves in such a way?\"\nI reply, \"I suppose I just didn't want to go to college, and I had a lot of trouble getting into a good school. My grades were terrible, and I was never able to figure out what I wanted to study, and I wasn't sure if I was cut out for the 'real world.'\" I pause, thinking, \"I guess I was depressed.\"\n\"Is there anything more that can be done to help alleviate the symptoms of depression?\" He inquires, and I answer, \"I haven't really thought much about that yet. I guess I was hoping that maybe I'd find a cure for my problem, or at least something to help me deal with the situation. Maybe I should ask for a prescription for an anti-depressant, or a mood stabilizer, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be taking.\nI wait for his response, \"What would you say if I told you that I am a psychiatrist, and I specialize in unusual cases? I'm not a medical doctor, but I do offer psychotherapy for those who need it. Would you consider me as an option for treatment?\"\nI look up at him, and his eyes are twinkling again, \"",

  "prompt": "I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",
  "result": "My name is Katherine, and I've been having problems.\"\nHe nods, \"Yes, tell me more about those problems.\"\nSo I do, and we talk for quite a while. We discuss my history, family life, school, work... things that I would never have thought to mention before, but now they seem important. And I feel much better after telling him all this. He asks questions, and I answer them honestly, and then he makes suggestions. Things just start coming together for me. It feels good to get something off my chest, even if only a little bit at a time. He is very patient, and listens intently without judgment.\nI can't believe how smart he is, and how charming too!  Afterwards I walk back to the receptionist area feeling lighter, and I say goodbye to him. As I leave, I realize that I really liked talking to him, and I want to go again. I hope I'll be able to schedule another appointment soon.\nI was walking home from the bus stop when I saw a sign that said \"Psychiatrist, Office Hours. 8am-9pm M-F\". I decided I'd give it a try. I walked in, and the woman at the front desk asked me a few routine questions, such as my age, address, etc. She didn't ask any personal questions or anything.\nI went up to the second floor, and the door was locked. I knocked, and waited for a minute. The door opened, and the doctor greeted me, \"Hello there, I'm Dr. Michael Szozas. How may I help you?\"\nI was a little surprised at his appearance, because I had expected a younger man. I guess that's the type of person he is, though. I replied, \"Hi, I'm Katherine. I think my problem might be related to my relationship with my boyfriend, but I'm not sure. I came",
