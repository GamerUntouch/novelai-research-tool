I tell him all about my family situation, and how I have been feeling lately, especially since this morning. How I had trouble sleeping last night because I couldn't stop thinking about my brother, my mother's boyfriends, and even the men from work. I didn't feel like myself today, and I felt angry and jealous whenever anyone looked at her. It was hard to concentrate, and I just wanted to leave the house.\nWhen I finish telling him about my day, I find myself wanting to cry, but I don't want to ruin our meeting by crying in front of him. Instead, I try to think about something else, anything else, but nothing comes to mind. Finally, after what feels like an eternity, Dr. Szozas speaks. He tells me that I seem very tense, which makes sense considering that I haven't slept well in days. And then he asks me if there is any way to help me sleep better tonight.\nIt was such a simple question, yet I can't answer him right away. My thoughts race through my head, trying to figure out how he would know that I wasn't sleeping well, or how to go about fixing it. What does he do? Does he give me pills to put me to sleep? Is he going to hypnotize me or use some other method to calm me down? Oh god, I hope not! I've heard too many horror stories about hypnosis and the things that people say when they are under its influence.\nFinally, I decide that I should ask Dr. Szozas about his methods, so I blurt, \"Dr. Szozas, may I please ask you about your methods?\"\n\"Of course!\" he answers, and his smile widens.
