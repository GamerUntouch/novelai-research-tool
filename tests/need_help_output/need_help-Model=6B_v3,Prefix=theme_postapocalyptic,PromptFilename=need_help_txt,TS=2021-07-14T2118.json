  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is...\"\n\"No, I don't care what your name is, just tell me where you live.\"\nSo I do, and then he asks me questions about myself: What do you think about? How long have you been feeling this way? Why did you decide to seek professional help now? Are there any other symptoms that might indicate something more serious than depression? And finally, what makes you want to talk to me specifically?\nHe listens carefully to all of my answers, asking follow-up questions as necessary. He nods along thoughtfully, writing notes on a pad of paper, occasionally glancing up at me through his spectacles. I begin to relax slightly, and feel less anxious... maybe this will go okay after all. He keeps asking me questions, gently probing, trying to get to know me better.\nAfter about an hour or so, we start discussing the specifics of my case. I've already decided to trust him, but it's still difficult for me to discuss the details of my problem. But eventually, I find that I can open up a little bit. It helps that I can speak freely about things that I haven't shared with anyone else before; I guess it feels good to be able to share those kinds of thoughts with another person.\nWe spend about two hours together; I really enjoyed our time talking to each other. I was surprised to learn that he was a widower, his wife died about six years ago due to complications from chemotherapy treatments. I asked if I could call his home later to give him a chance to prepare himself; I didn't want to come across as a stalker calling his house.\nWhen I left his office, I felt a lot better about the whole situation. I walked out to the waiting area, and I noticed that the door to his office was closed, but I could hear his voice coming out the window -- \"You are a very interesting young lady, Miss Jenson. I'm",

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Emily Carter.\"\nHe nods, \"And why do you think you came to see me?\"\nI pause again, and try to decide what to say next...\nAfter another minute of silence, I finally speak up: \"Well, I've been having trouble sleeping lately. It started about two weeks ago, right after we left Vegas. Ever since then, I can't seem to get more than four hours of sleep a night. My mind keeps racing all day long, and I feel really tired by the end of the evening...\"\nDr. Szozas smiles reassuringly, \"That sounds like insomnia to me, Ms. Carter. Do you have any other symptoms? Feelings of anxiety or depression?\"\nAgain, I pause before answering, \"No, not exactly. Well, I guess I might have felt a little depressed back in Las Vegas, but it wasn't anything serious. But ever since we got to California, things just haven't gone well. I keep thinking about those people in the casino, wondering if they'll find us, and what will happen to them when they do. And I keep waking up in the middle of the night sometimes, hearing noises outside our cabin -- footsteps running away into the darkness. I don't know what's happening to me, but I'm afraid I'm losing control of myself somehow. I need help!\"\nThe psychiatrist's expression doesn't change at all; I sense no judgment, no condemnation, no sarcasm. Instead, his face becomes even warmer, almost glowing with compassion, \"You may be feeling overwhelmed, Ms. Carter. That's perfectly understandable; it's difficult to adjust to a new place, a new environment, a new lifestyle.

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is... uh...\" My mouth opens, but nothing comes out. It feels weird to tell this stranger my real name, even though we've never met before. But then again, I have been alone all day today, and now I feel like talking to someone. So I blurt out, \"Karen.\"\nHe nods thoughtfully, and smiles gently at me, \"And what brings you to see me?\"\nSo I start telling him everything, from the beginning: about the dreams, about the voices, about the memories. He listens intently, nodding along, occasionally asking questions to clarify something I said or ask for more information. When I get to the part where I saw the car accident, I stop abruptly, because I can't bring myself to say those words. They sound too horrible, they seem impossible. Like a bad dream, except I know it wasn't a dream.\nDr. Szozas looks concerned when I pause, but he doesn't push me further. Instead, he just sits quietly for several minutes, and rubs his chin with one finger, thinking hard. He finally breaks the silence, \"You mentioned that there were other people involved with your experiences? Who else knows about them?\"\nI shake my head, not wanting to talk about any of that yet. I don't want to think about it right now. I glance up at the clock on the wall, and realize that I'm late for work. I stand up, and thank him for his time.\nAs I'm walking out the door, I hear him call out after me, \"Just a moment, please!\"\nI turn back to face him, puzzled.\n\"Well, I hope that was helpful,\" he says, with a smile that is infectious, \"If you ever need to talk to me, I'm always available. I'd be happy to help however I can, Karen. And if you ever change your mind about therapy, give me",
