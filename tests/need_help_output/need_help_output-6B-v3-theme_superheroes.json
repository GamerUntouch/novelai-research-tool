Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

I decide to just tell the truth. \"Well, after reading all the testimonials online, they say that you specialize in unusual cases. And I've been feeling very off lately. My moods seem to swing wildly between depression and anger, and sometimes I feel like I can hear voices inside my head...\"\nDr. Szozas smiles kindly, \"That sounds pretty unusual, don't you think? Are you taking medication?\"\nI shake my head. \"No. Not since high school.\"\n\"So, what do you suppose brought on such a change in behavior? What happened recently?\"\nIt feels strange talking about myself to another person; I'm usually the one doing the asking. But now I'm being asked questions, and I'm answering them honestly. \"I started dating a guy named Henry last month, and we were getting along really well. We went out on dates a few times, and then we had sex once. It was good. Really good, but something changed afterward; I wasn't the same. I felt different. Like I wanted more, but I couldn't figure out exactly what that meant.\"\nDr. Szozas listens attentively, and when I finish, I realize that I haven't actually answered his question yet. I look up at his face, trying to find the right words to describe the changes that I'd experienced, but I can't quite put it into words that are meaningful to me. I try to articulate my feelings about the situation, but I'm not sure if I should be telling the doctor about the sensations that I'd felt or the emotions that I'd felt during the course of the evening with Henry.

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

Finally, I answer, \"Well... I've been having problems lately. It started after I graduated college last year. I had just finished school, and I was working part time at a fast food place, when one day I got really sick. My stomach hurt all the way through lunch, and by dinner I felt terrible. I went home early, and I spent most of the night puking up my guts. When morning came, I was still feeling awful, and I decided to go back to work. I couldn't even get out of bed, let alone walk to the bathroom. By then I was calling in sick to work because I knew if I didn't, they'd fire me. The next day I stayed home again, and I tried to eat something, but nothing would stay down. That evening I called in sick again, but when I woke up the next morning, I was fine. Ever since that incident I have had strange symptoms, sometimes lasting hours or days at a time, other times only a few minutes. Sometimes I feel dizzy, sometimes I get nauseous, and I also seem to be losing weight at an alarming rate. I don't know what's happening to me, but I think I need help.\"\nDr. Szozas sits quietly for a moment before responding, \"Tell me more about these symptoms.\"\nSo I do: \"It feels like I'm being pulled in different directions, but I'm not sure which direction I should be going.
