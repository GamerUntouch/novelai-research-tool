=== Prompt ========================================
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "

=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Sarah Jane Smith."
He nods, "And why have you chosen to seek help?"
Now I know this is where I should start telling him all about it, but I can't bring myself to do it. The last time I spoke with Mrs. Jones she said something very important, and I want to remember what she said before I go any further. But now I feel like I've been thrown into a dark room without a light switch, and I don't even know which way to turn.
So instead I say, "It started yesterday morning. I woke up early, and went downstairs to get breakfast. My dad was already gone. Mom wasn't home yet. I ate breakfast alone, and then I headed back upstairs to shower and dress. When I got up there, mom was still asleep. She looked exhausted. Her hair was disheveled, her makeup was smeared, and she had circles under her eyes. And she smelled terrible."
Dr. Szozas listens intently to my story. His eyebrows knit together with concern, "Did anything unusual happen during the day? Anything out of the ordinary?"
I shake my head, "No...nothing really happened until after dinner. I'd just finished eating when I heard a knock at the door. It was my brother Brian, with his friend Jeff. They came in and sat at the table with us. We were talking about school when I noticed that mom seemed distracted, preoccupied. I asked if they wanted to watch a movie, but neither one of them responded. After a few minutes, I decided to leave the kitchen. I saw mom standing by the front door, staring off into space. I didn't think much of it at the time, but later I realized that I hadn't seen either of my parents look at each other since I arrived home. I left the house and walked to the bus stop. I was thinking about the fact

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Jane Smith."
He nods, "And why are you here?"
"Well..." I begin, "It all started last week when I was watching TV... there was this show called 'The Mentalist'. It's really good, very cleverly written. And they had a scene where Patrick Jane (the lead character) was interviewing a suspect about a murder case. They were talking about whether the person knew anything about the crime or not, and then the detective asks them what their favorite color is. The guy said red, and the detective asked if it was a primary or secondary color, and he answered, 'Primary.' The detective was surprised by that answer because usually people say blue or green when they think about their favorite colors, but the guy just blurted out red. And that was the clue that solved the entire mystery. But after the interview ended, I couldn't get the image out of my head: a primary colored shirt against a white background. That's when I realized something was wrong with me."
Dr. Szozas smiles gently at me, "You've been having vivid dreams about being inside a bright red box. You have trouble remembering things that happened during the day, but if you try to recall details about the dream, they fade away almost instantly. Do you remember any other symptoms?"
"Yes, I do. When I watch television, I often find myself staring at the screen, and I feel compelled to click through the channels until I arrive at the program that I want to view, but I can't seem to stop. I also experience a feeling that I am trying to force my way into a space that is too small for me, and I keep thinking about a bright light shining into my face. I don't know if these are side effects from the medication that I am taking, but I am experiencing a lot of strange feelings. I'm scared that I might hurt myself."
Dr.

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Jane Smith."
He nods, "And what brings you to me?"
Well, I've already decided to tell him all about myself, including my past relationships, my sexual history, my current relationship status, and how I feel right now...but there is one more part to this story that needs telling. The other part involves my mother.
As I begin talking, Dr. Szozas sits forward, leaning slightly toward me, his chair creaking under the pressure. As I speak, he listens intently, occasionally nodding his head in agreement or asking questions, which I answer truthfully. I know he will want to hear about what happened last night, and I don't think I can lie about it any longer. I have to let him know.
When I finish speaking, Dr. Szozas looks up at me with those bright blue eyes, "So, I understand that you were recently diagnosed with Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD). How long ago was that diagnosis made? And did they explain to you the cause?"
I start to reply, "It wasn't exactly a 'diagnosis', I had been exhibiting signs of MPD for years before the official diagnosis."
Dr. Szozas asks another question, "What kind of symptoms do you exhibit?"
I give an example, "Last week I went to bed, and I woke up the next morning to find that I'd lost my virginity. I didn't even realize that I'd done anything until I saw the bloodstains on the sheets..."
Dr. Szozas smiles, "I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if that qualifies as a symptom of MPD. It sounds to me like you just need to be sexually active. If that's the case, then I would recommend that you stop trying to control your urges with drugs, and instead focus on finding the right partner with whom you can be intimate with

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Anna."
He nods, "And why do you think you should see me?"
"Well... I have this feeling inside me that something isn't right..."
"Yes? What do you feel?"
"...like there's something wrong with me..."
"What makes you say that?"
"I don't know... I just get this sense that I've done something bad, or am doing something terrible, and I can't remember what it was... It's driving me crazy."
"OK. Let's start by asking a few questions. Do you ever drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes?"
"No," I reply.
"Do you use any prescription drugs such as Ritalin, Adderall, Prozac, etc?"
"No," I answer.
"Have you had any prior psychological counseling?"
"No," I tell him.
"Are you sexually active?"
"Yeah, sometimes, but not recently."
"Do you masturbate frequently?"
"Sometimes," I admit.
"Any other sexual problems?"
"I'm having trouble getting aroused lately," I confess.
"How often do you orgasm during sex with a partner?"
"Usually only once, if that, when I climax, but I still enjoy the experience when I manage to cum at all."
Dr. Szozas pauses, "Anna, I'd like to ask you if you are currently seeing a therapist, psychiatrist, counselor, psychologist, or anyone else that is helping with your problem."
"No, I haven't been, but I want to. I need help, I really do. I need to figure out what I did that I can't recall, but I also want to stop the feelings that are causing me distress. I want them gone forever."
Dr. Szozas is nodding

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Elizabeth Shuey."
He nods, and then asks, "And why did you contact me?"
"Well..." I say hesitantly. My mind goes blank. I have never had trouble speaking before, but now I find myself struggling. It isn't that I don't know what to say, but there is something holding back my words. Something about this doctor...he makes me feel safe. Safe enough to speak freely? Is that even possible?
He smiles again, and sits forward in his chair. "What do you remember about last night?"
Oh shit. That was bad. I start talking faster than I ever have before, "Last night, I woke up naked in bed with my boyfriend. We were having sex, and I guess I blacked out or fell asleep because when I opened my eyes, I was still inside him. And I couldn't move, I couldn't get away, I couldn't wake up. I just lay there watching him sleep next to me while we fucked each other senseless. He didn't seem to care that I was awake; all he cared about was getting off. But I couldn't stop thinking, 'what if I can't get out?' I started to panic, I thought I might suffocate. I kept trying to scream, but nothing came out. I tried moving, but I couldn't. I wanted to run out of the room, but I couldn't even stand. I felt like I was dying. I finally managed to break free from his grip, but I ran out of the house. I went to a coffee shop nearby, hoping to calm down and think about what happened. I got a latte, but I wasn't really paying attention to anything. I just sat and sipped the drink until I realized I hadn't paid. I left the coffee shop without a word to anyone, and I walked home. I called his cell phone to try to apologize

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Stephanie Rennie."
He nods, "And why do you think you've been experiencing problems?"
"Well, I guess because I don't know myself very well. It all started last month after I went through a breakup... I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said anything..."
"It's alright, please continue. What happened? You were involved with this person, right?"
"Yes, we had been together for three years. And then suddenly one day she just left me without any explanation. She even took her stuff. I called her cell phone several times, but there was never an answer. That night I was really upset, crying in bed until 4am. I felt like I'd lost something important to me. The next morning I decided to go online, and search for help. I found a site that seemed to offer support for people suffering similar issues to mine, so I sent them a message. They responded within minutes, saying they would provide me with information about what was happening inside my head, and how to get past it. I did exactly as they suggested. In the end, I learned that I wasn't crazy or losing touch with reality, but that I needed to change some things about my life. I began reading articles about relationships, and I realized that I wanted to be in a relationship again, but I didn't want to feel the way I did before I broke up with her. I read about other types of relationships too, such as open marriages, polyamory, and swinging. I came across a lot of sites that talked about these topics, but I also read a few that were more specific to the problem I was having: infidelity. I read about the different kinds of affairs, and I read about the psychological effects of cheating. I read about the guilt, the shame, the fear, the frustration, the anger. I read about the betrayal, the loss, the pain.

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Sarah Ann Smith."
He nods thoughtfully, then looks back at me, "Sarah Ann Smith? And where do you live?"
Again, I pause before answering, "In Virginia."
"And what brings you to my office today?"
I think for a moment, and then answer, "Well, I guess I just wanted to talk to somebody."
"Do you have any other friends or family members that can help you through this time?"
Another hesitation, another pause, "No..."
Dr. Szozas leans forward, "So tell me Sarah Ann, how long have you been experiencing symptoms such as those we've discussed together?"
"Um... three years now."
"Have they ever gotten worse or better?"
"Worse, always worse."
"Has anything changed recently that might explain your current state of mind?"
"Not really. Nothing much has happened since I moved out there, except work and school. That's about all."
"Would you say that things are going well at home?"
"I suppose. We get along alright, but nothing too exciting."
Dr. Szozas smiles at me again, "How did you find me? I don't advertise very often."
"It was an online search."
"An internet search. What was the key word that brought you to my site?"
"Uh... 'unusual case'. I wasn't sure if I was an unusual case, but I was curious about seeing a doctor about it anyway."
"Yes, I see. How are you feeling emotionally right now?"
"Scared, and confused, and I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing by coming to see you."
"What are the specific emotions that are causing you distress?"
I sigh heavily, "You know I'm

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Amy Smith."
He nods, and then asks, "Amy, would you please tell me what brought you here today?"
Again, I pause before responding, "Well...I have this recurring nightmare where I'm in bed, naked under the covers, with three men. They start kissing each other, and they move their hands all over me..." I stop talking because I feel myself blushing, embarrassed by what I just said. But then I continue, "They touch my breasts, caress them, play with my nipples. And one guy reaches between my legs and starts playing with my pussy while another sucks on my tits. It gets very intense, really arousing, and I can't help but moan loudly as I climax."
Dr. Szozas listens intently to my story, nodding his head slightly as he makes notes on his tablet computer. After I finish telling him about my dream, I ask, "Is there something wrong with me? Am I sick or anything?"
He smiles reassuringly at me, "No, not at all. You're perfectly healthy; we'll get to the bottom of this, don't worry. I'm just making sure that we cover everything, okay? Do you want to talk about the details of the dream, or do you prefer to skip ahead?"
I shrug, "Either way works fine with me." I sigh, feeling relieved to finally be able to unburden my heart to somebody, even if only a doctor. I open up to him about the whole ordeal, from the beginning: the dreams, the internet searches, the masturbation sessions I've been having with the vibrator. I describe the scene that I had last night, the three guys with me, the orgasms that I experienced. I confess that I masturbated with the dildo after the first time I dreamed about the threesome, but I didn't cum that day. I admit that I was

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Jane Smith."
He nods encouragingly, "And?"
I pause again, this time because I want to say something profound, something meaningful, something wise beyond my years. But all that comes out is, "Well...um..."
Dr. Szozas chuckles gently, "It's alright, don't worry about trying to impress me right now. We have plenty of time for that later. Just tell me what brings you here today."
So I start talking: "I've been having trouble sleeping lately, ever since I started working more than 40 hours per week. It used to be just bad dreams after work, but they haven't gone away, and now I can't seem to get any rest before bedtime either. I wake up feeling groggy, and when I do sleep, I dream of things that scare me, and then I feel guilty when I awake. And sometimes, I just lie there staring at the ceiling, thinking about nothing until morning comes. It's driving me crazy, and I need help."
Dr. Szozas smiles broadly, "That was very good, Jane. You did great!"
I smile back at him gratefully, "Thank you."
He leans forward, "Now I think we should talk about the nightmares that you mentioned earlier. Do you remember them? What were they about?"
I shake my head, "No, I guess not."
He sighs, "Okay, let me try to refresh your memory. When you described the dream to me last night, I asked you to describe the setting, and the content of the nightmare. Can you recall that?"
I nod, "Yes, I remembered that too. I dreamed that I was walking through the woods at night. I felt lost and scared, but I kept moving, trying to find the way out. I had a flashlight, but I couldn't see anything

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Karen."
He nods, encouragingly, "Karen, go ahead."
"Well...I've been feeling different lately..." I start slowly, then continue, "...but I don't know what it means. It started off small things: little changes in behavior patterns, sometimes even minute mood shifts. But now it feels more intense, like something inside me is changing. And I feel...different, somehow."
He smiles, "How do you feel?"
"Different, strange. Like there's a part of me missing, and it scares me a little because I can't seem to figure out where it went or what happened to it. Sometimes I feel lonely, other times I feel really angry, and I have trouble controlling myself when I get upset. I also find myself thinking weird thoughts all the time, especially if I'm alone for too long. I keep having dreams about being trapped underground, and I think they may be prophetic, but I just don't understand them. I want to talk to somebody else who knows what this is all about."
Dr. Szozas looks up at me, "You sound very troubled. What did you say the name of your doctor was again?"
"Michael Szozas," I respond hesitantly.
"And what is your phone number?"
"908-555-8671," I tell him.
"Good girl," he chuckles at me, and I smile back at him.
"So, I'm going to ask you some questions, and I'd like to hear the answers to each one of them from you. Is that alright? I promise I won't be offended by anything that comes out of your mouth. I'll be honest with you, I'm not sure exactly how to proceed with this, but I'm willing to try." He pauses, and his voice is gentle when he speaks next, "Do
