=== Prompt ========================================
I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.

[Year: 2020 AD]
[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "


=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Milly, and I've been seeing this doctor named Michael Szozas about an issue that I have."
He nods thoughtfully, then looks back up at me, "And what might that 'issue' be?"
I swallow hard, and think for a moment, before responding, "It started after I had sex with a girl I liked very much. She was 18 years old, and we were dating for almost two months. We got along really well, but she didn't want to date anymore. Her parents weren't too happy either, but they let her do whatever she wanted. Anyway, one day I went home early, and I found her masturbating to porn videos on our computer.   I was furious, because I knew exactly which ones she'd chosen, and I was worried that I would catch her doing something similar again. I confronted her, and she admitted that she did watch the same stuff I did, and that she wasn't embarrassed by it. It turned out that she watched the same porno movies I did, except hers were more extreme. I felt bad, and I tried to tell myself that I should just move on, but I couldn't help it. I ended up having a lot of fun watching the porno vids, and I began to wonder if I could get away with watching them without getting caught. I even asked my girlfriend if I could borrow a few for a little while, and she said yes, I guess I can say that I stole the pornos. I snuck into the house at night, hid the box in my room, and I secretly watched the movies I took from my girlfriend's bedroom. I always made sure to hide the evidence when I left the house, and I never told anyone that I watched the porno films. I don't know if I ever told my girlfriend, and I'm not sure how I feel about it now. I guess I'm still a virgin, and

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Daphne Riggs. My last name starts with an 'S', which is pretty common, and my first name is pronounced roughly like a French word. It means something similar to 'hope'. I've been seeing a therapist named Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having.
He nods, and looks at me quizzically, "And what do you think is causing this problem?"
I swallow hard, and try to speak calmly, "I have... sexual fantasies."
Dr. Szozas blinks rapidly, then he smiles again, "That sounds serious enough. Go ahead."
I glance at the clock, and realize I haven't eaten anything since breakfast.  So I excuse myself to go get a cup of coffee, and grab a muffin while I wait. I come back, and tell the doctor my story. I describe the dreams, the feelings of arousal, the thoughts, the images, and the emotions. He listens intently, and asks questions, and jots notes on a yellow legal pad that is lying on his lap.
I finish, "I want to know if there is a way to stop the urges, or if I should just accept that I'm a lesbian, or if I should seek help elsewhere. I don't feel that I can handle this alone. I'm not sure if I need professional help, or if I'm being silly. I'm afraid to admit that I'm gay, but I'm also ashamed to hide it. I'm confused, and I don't know where to turn for help."
The doctor sets the pen aside, and leans forward in his chair, "Daph, I understand the dilemma you are facing. I am not a psychiatrist, and I'm certainly no expert, but I will give you my best advice. I suggest that you talk to a few people who might be able to offer some insight into your situation. I'll write a referral letter

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Rene Cavanaugh."
He nods, "And what brings you here today?"
I pause again, "Well... I've been having issues lately..."
Szozas sits forward, resting his elbows on his knees, "What sort of issues? Are they sexual or otherwise?"
I blush, "No, not exactly..."
"Then let's start there. Tell me what happened. Start from the beginning," he encourages.
So I tell him about my job interview, and the awkwardness when I saw myself in the mirror after shaving off my beard. The way I felt embarrassed by my body. And then I talk about feeling lonely at home, and wanting more friends. About the fact that my girlfriend broke up with me last week, and now I feel depressed, and I don't know where to turn.   I explain that I went to the doctor, and I was diagnosed with depression, but I wasn't sure if the medication would help.
Dr. Szozas listens attentively to all my concerns, nodding and smiling occasionally. He asks questions, and I answer honestly. I think I have done a good job because when I finish speaking, he looks at me, his expression serious, but not stern or angry.
Finally, he speaks, "You seem to be doing well, Rene. I can see that you are taking this seriously. You're a smart young man, and I believe that you will do well in life. I also believe that you should get the help you need, and I'm willing to recommend a therapist for you. 
I thank him for his time and attention, and I leave his office. I walk out into the sunlight, and I breathe in the fresh air. I am a little disappointed, though; it seemed like I had really opened up to Dr. Szozas, and I thought I was going to get some kind of solution. I guess I'll just keep

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Samara Rennick. And I've been seeing Dr. Szozas about a problem that I have."
He nods, then asks, "What sort of problem?"
"Well...it's hard to explain..."
"Try us," he smiles.
So I tell him, "It started about six months ago when I noticed that I was getting really horny all the time. My sex drive had always been high, but now it seemed like there was just this constant urge inside me to get fucked. I masturbated constantly, sometimes several times a day. It felt good at first, but after awhile, I got tired of it. I didn't want to feel that way anymore. I wanted something different, more than what I'd known before.
Then one night I decided to go online and do a little research. I found a lot of websites on the subject, and I read them. I learned a few things that I hadn't known. I found out that I wasn't alone in feeling the way I did. There were other women out there who shared my desire for a new experience. I found out that I was a submissive, and I liked it.
I discovered a whole world out there, and I knew I needed to explore it. I found a site called 'Dominatrix In Training', and I joined. I thought it would help me learn a bit about myself, and maybe even find a partner or two for some fun. But it turned out to be much bigger than I expected.
I met a woman named Dominika, and she became my mentor, and my teacher. She taught me a lot, and I grew to trust her, and to respect her. I found out that I loved the idea of being controlled by a dominant, and I began to crave it. I craved the submission, the humiliation, the degradation. I craved to be used, to be owned, to be dominated.

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Bekah Smith, and I've been feeling weird lately."
He nods, "Tell me more."
So I do. "Well, I feel like something isn't right with me, but I don't know what's wrong or how to figure it out. It started about two weeks ago when I woke up one morning, and felt really sick. My head hurt, and I couldn't move very well. I was sweating, and shaking all over. I thought maybe I had the flu or something, because I hadn't gotten much sleep and I didn't have any appetite. But then my stomach started hurting too, and I threw up a few times after that. And the next day, I felt even worse than before. The following days were pretty similar, except that I was able to get out of bed and go for a walk outside, which was a relief. I was still tired and nauseous, though."
Dr. Szozas listens attentively, and I continue, "Then yesterday I just felt horrible again, and I went to the bathroom, and I realized I was bleeding between my legs. I was in pain, and I was scared. I was in the shower when I noticed the blood, and I was terrified. I ran out of the bathroom and called my mom, and she came home early from work. I was crying, and I was afraid to tell her what was happening. I was scared, I was embarrassed, and I was worried. I was in the hospital for a while, and they gave me some tests. They found out I wasn't pregnant, and I was discharged. I'm not sure if I'm in a lot of physical pain, but I think I might be having a miscarriage."
Dr. Szozas asks, "Did you see a doctor?"
I shake my head, "No, I haven't seen a doctor, and I'm not going to see a doctor, either.

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Samara Taggart. I've been seeing Dr. Szozas for about two months now, and I really want to get better. But I don't know what 'better' means."
Szozas looks at me curiously, "Do you have any physical symptoms?"
"No," I say, shaking my head. "But I feel weird sometimes. Like things aren't quite right. And I just can't seem to concentrate. It feels like there are too many thoughts running through my brain at once, and they're all jumbled up together. Sometimes I lose track of time, and then I'll realize I've spent hours doing nothing but thinking. When I try to do something, it doesn't work right away, and when I think back on it later, it sounds hazy. I guess I should mention that I'm pretty shy. I've never really had a lot of friends, and I'm not very good at talking to people. I have trouble making eye contact, especially when I'm nervous. I'm not sure if I'm being rude, or if I'm not saying anything at all."
He nods, "I understand. You said that you were feeling strange, and not concentrating. Have you ever felt this way before? Has anyone else noticed this problem?"
I nod, "Yes, I used to have a friend named Marissa. She was a girl, a few years older than me. We hung out a lot, and she was really nice to me. I liked her a lot, and we got along great. I was a little worried at first, because I didn't think I would fit in at school, and I thought maybe I'd be a freak or something. I remember one day when Marissa went home sick, and I started to worry that I might not go out to play with her anymore. I asked my mom if I could stay at my house, and I could tell by

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Alexie Darrow."
He smiles again, and nods. "And why are you here?"
I pause, because this is hard. It feels strange, almost awkward, but I try to explain myself, "Well, I have been feeling depressed lately. I can't seem to stop thinking about things that I've done wrong, or people that I hurt. Things that I wish I'd never said, or didn't do. And then I feel guilty for even having those thoughts, but they still pop into my head. They won't go away. I don't know what to do..."
Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair, and folds his hands together on top of the desk, "Alexie, I think we should start by talking about something else. Tell me more about the things that have happened recently that led to your depression."
I tell him all about my breakup with my girlfriend last year, my job loss a few months ago, and my mother's death a couple years before that. I also talk about the stressors that I felt during the day-to-day life at work, and the various stresses that I faced in my personal life. I tell him about my anger issues, and my anxiety, and my guilt, and my shame. I mention that I'm seeing a counselor, and I hope that will help, I say.
When I finish, I ask, "So, now that I've told you everything, does any of that sound familiar? Does anything strike a chord with you?"
Dr. Szozas looks at me, and he says, "I'm not sure. I'll need a little time to process, and I want to be completely honest, and I want to give you my best professional opinion. Can I get some coffee, and a doughnut or two, and maybe a glass of water, while I do that?"
I nod, and he stands up, "

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Caren Zingara. It's not uncommon for people to call me Carla."
He smiles again, and asks, "And what brings you to our little clinic today?"
"Well, um... I've been having trouble sleeping lately, and I wanted to talk to somebody about it, maybe get some advice."
"CARE!"
I can tell by the tone of his voice that something important just happened. He sits up straight in his chair, and looks at me intently, "Did you say 'care'? Do you want to talk about care? Is there anything else we should cover before we begin?"
Oh shit.   What the hell did I do now? I'm confused, embarrassed, scared, and uncertain what is happening. He stands up, and starts pacing back and forth, "Let's start at the beginning. When was the last time you had a good night sleep? What makes this day different than the other days in which you slept well?"
I'm feeling a bit lost, and a bit more anxious. "Um..." I stammer.
Dr. Szozas turns to face me, and his smile is still present, but a bit sad, "Do you have any idea when the last time was that you got a decent night's rest, or the difference between a normal day and a bad one for you, or a better understanding of the reason for your insomnia, or if you think you might be depressed?"
I'm a bit overwhelmed, and I feel a little silly for being in his office, for not knowing that I need help. I shake my head no, I don't know the answer to his question.
Dr. Szozas sighs, and his eyes look a bit pained, "I'm sorry to hear that. You seem to have a lot of issues going on in your life right now. Let's work together to try to resolve those things,

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Tania Elle Davenport. My father died last year, and left me this house, which I inherited after being named sole executor of his will." I pause, then add, "This is a little embarrassing, but I've been seeing a therapist about issues regarding my sexuality."
He nods, and asks, "What sort of issues?"
I answer, "Well, uh... I guess I don't know yet? It's complicated..." I can feel myself blushing, and I realize that I have let my guard down with this guy.
Dr. Szozas smiles, "Tell me more," he encourages, "Do you remember what happened to cause the issue?"
I nod, and I say, "It was something that happened when I was thirteen years old. I went on a school field trip to Washington DC, and I met a boy at the hotel. We had a wonderful time together, and I even thought we might become a couple. I think I would have liked to go out with him, if I hadn't lost my virginity before I turned eighteen. I'd never done anything sexual with a boy, and I didn't want to start now, not until I knew for sure if I wanted to be gay or not. I told my boyfriend at the time, and he said that he understood, and he wasn't upset. I kissed the boy, and I gave him my phone number. I just assumed I wouldn't hear from him again, and I certainly didn't expect a call two weeks later. He asked if I wanted to hang out, and I agreed. I ended up having sex with the boy, and I felt guilty. I still do. I'm not sure if I should tell Dr. Szozas all of this, I'm really confused, and I'm afraid I'll offend him.
I wait for his reaction, and I watch his face carefully. He doesn't show any obvious signs

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is  . My parents were killed by terrorists, and I survived. I was lucky."
He nods, and then continues, "Tell me more about this terrorist attack?"
I tell him all about it, how I was shot and stabbed, but somehow managed to survive. The whole time I talk, he just listens intently, nodding occasionally. When I finish, there is silence.
Dr. Szozas breaks the silence, "And do you feel better now than before? Do you feel like things will get worse if you don't address the issue that led to you being attacked in the first place?"
I nod, "Yes. I think I have to face my past, and confront what happened. It may not bring back those people I loved, but at least I'll know they aren't dead anymore."
Dr. Szozas nods again, and asks, "What did happen?"
I start talking about my childhood, growing up in a small town, the local kids teasing me, the bullies hitting and kicking me, the teachers ignoring my plight, the church trying to convince me that God had a plan for me, and I was special, and I would go to heaven. I was raised to believe I was born for a purpose, and I was destined for greatness. I was a good kid, and I tried to be a good person, and I wanted to help others, and I believed I was doing a great job, and I worked hard, and I didn't want to disappoint anyone.
I tell the story, and I try to explain my feelings at the end, when I was told I wasn't chosen for the afterlife. I felt betrayed and abandoned, and I lost faith in everything.
Dr. Szozas looks at me, and he says softly, "I understand."
That's when I realize I've been speaking for a long time, and I'm still sitting on the couch.
I say
