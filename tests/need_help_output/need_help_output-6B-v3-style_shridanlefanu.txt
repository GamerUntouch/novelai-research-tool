My name is Daphne."
He smiles gently at me, then continues, "And what brings you here?"
It feels good to talk to this person, and I feel more relaxed than I have been since arriving at the hotel. I tell him, "Well, I've had some problems recently, and I think they might stem from something I saw online."
"So let us begin by telling me what brought you to this website in particular. How did you get there? What were you searching for?" he asks, leaning forward intently.
"Oh, um... well..." I stammer, feeling suddenly uncomfortable. The truth is, I don't remember much about how I got there, except that I typed 'anal sex' into Google, and clicked on one of the links that came up. It was just a list of videos, most of which seemed to involve either strap-ons or dildos being used on men or women. There weren't any pictures, but I guess the Internet doesn't need them to sell their wares.
Dr. Szozas listens patiently to my story, nodding occasionally, asking a few questions along the way, before concluding, "So you found a site that featured anal sex, and the very next day you went to another site featuring exactly the same content. You can't deny that, now can you?"
"But I didn't know about that other website until today!" I protest.
"What do you mean, you didn't know about the second website? Why would that surprise you? This is the 21st century, we live in a world where everything is interconnected, isn't that right?"
"Yes sir, but I never looked at that first link; I only clicked on the second one!"
"That is strange behavior, wouldn't you agree? I mean, if you'd already seen the first video, and that was all you wanted to see, why not click

My name is Annabelle Jones."
He smiles broadly, "And why are you here?"
"Well, I've been experiencing... um... uh..." My mind goes blank.
"Annabelle, please don't worry about this, just tell me what's troubling you. What brings you to our offices today? Are you feeling anxious or depressed? Do you have any concerns about your health? Any fears or worries about anything else? Is there something you'd like to talk about? Anything at all, I want to hear it all. Please, go ahead," he urges.
So I begin: "OK, I'm having trouble sleeping, I feel exhausted all day long, even though I get plenty of sleep. I can't seem to concentrate at work anymore, I'm distracted by things that shouldn't concern me. I keep thinking about things that happened years ago, stuff that doesn't matter now. I'm worried about my husband; he's not himself lately, he won't let me help him with chores or do other things that used to come easily to us. We never fight about money; we always share expenses equally. But lately he gets angry if I ask him for help with the dishes, the laundry, the cleaning up, he yells at me to stop bothering him, to leave him alone! He was fine when I got home late last night, but when I woke up at 6am I found him gone. I had to call the police to find out where he was. I guess I should be happy that I didn't wake up to a stranger, but I'm really upset about it. I'm afraid that I'll lose him again, I know I haven't handled this very well, but I need his support. I need to be able to count on him!" I pause to catch my breath.
Dr. Szozas listens intently, his face serious but kind. He nods a few times while I speak, then he

My name is Claire Denslow."
He nods, then asks, "And what brings you here today?"
"Well, um... I've been feeling very stressed lately, and I think something might have happened to me while I was asleep. It feels like I can't get enough air, and sometimes I feel dizzy, or sick. And then there are other things..." I pause, thinking hard about what else to say, and finally decide to just blurt it all out: "There are dreams, too. Not nightmares exactly, more like vivid memories, but not real ones either. They seem really important somehow, even though they aren't happening now. Sometimes I wake up crying because I don't know what's wrong with me, or where I am."
Dr. Szozas listens attentively, nodding occasionally. "That sounds a lot like hypoxia," he observes thoughtfully. "It happens to people when their body doesn't get enough oxygen. That's a common symptom of sleep deprivation, which would explain the memory loss. You're right about that part; those are probably not real memories. In fact, they may be fragments of dream images. Have you ever had any dreams involving flying? Or falling?"
"No," I reply slowly, trying to remember.
"Have you ever felt that you were dreaming about being underwater?"
"Yes!" I exclaim, surprised.
"Good!" He smiles, and pats the cushion beside him. I rise up and move closer to the edge of the sofa, and I settle myself into the chair. I watch his face intently as he speaks.
"So, let me ask you a few questions, and I'd appreciate it if you answer honestly. Are you a good swimmer?"
"Um, I guess I am," I reply hesitantly.
"Then try to picture a swimming pool. Can you do that?"
I stare at him, and I

My name is Mary Katherine Smith."
He smiles again, this time a little more broadly, "And why do you think you're here?"
I pause before answering, and then say quietly, "Because I have had a very strange experience recently."
"Do tell...what happened?" he asks gently, and with genuine curiosity.
So I begin to explain what happened to me, and he listens intently, nodding occasionally. When I finish, he asks, "Did anything else happen? Any other experiences or thoughts that might relate to what you've just described?"
I shake my head.
"Is there anything else we should discuss regarding your visit today?"
I answer, "No, not really. Thank you very much for seeing me."
"You're welcome. Now, would you mind if I ask you one question? It will help us determine whether or not we need to schedule another appointment," he inquires.
"Of course!" I reply instantly.
"Would you please describe exactly what you saw when you were looking through the web?"
That was a good question. I thought about it carefully before responding, "It looked like a window into somebody's soul. There was a person inside, and they seemed to be suffering terribly; I felt sorry for them, but I also wanted to protect them somehow. The pain that I sensed coming from the person trapped within the web was intense, but I didn't know how to stop the torture from happening to the poor soul."
Dr. Szozas nods slowly to himself, "OK, thank you. I'll be back in a moment. If I can get a hold of your insurance information, I'll write up a prescription for the medication that I prescribe to patients with similar symptoms. I hope that helps. Please let me know if I can ever be of service to you further. Have a nice day, Ms. Smith."
I smile, and I rise up to leave.

My name is Gwen. My father died recently." And then I pause, because there is something more than this. Something that I haven't said yet. But I can't quite put my finger on what it is... Oh yes, I know exactly what it is: I have fallen in love with Dr. Szozas. I don't know how else to describe it. It's such a lovely feeling. A warmth fills my chest, spreading through my body, filling my head with joy.
He looks at me quizzically, "Gwen, tell me about your father?"
And I begin talking, telling him about our family history, about my mother's death, her illness, and finally about my father's passing. As I talk I feel myself relax, and I become more animated, perhaps even excited by the subject matter. I've never had much to do with my family before now, and I find it fascinating to share this with somebody, especially a doctor.
Dr. Szozas listens intently to my story, nodding occasionally, asking questions when necessary. He asks about my childhood memories of my parents, and whether they were loving or not. I think about this for a moment, trying to remember back to those days. I'm pretty sure that they weren't bad, but I'm having trouble recalling any specific instances of them being good either.
As I'm thinking about all of this, I realize that I'm actually enjoying the conversation, and I'm surprised at that fact. I'm also becoming aware that I'm very interested in the man sitting across from me. I want to learn about his life, his experiences, his hopes and dreams. I wonder if he knows how beautiful he is?
After I finish speaking about my father, Dr. Szozas sits quietly, his hands clasped together, his gaze fixed upon me. I feel that we are communicating without words; I'm certain that he is hearing me just fine,

My name is Emily Smith." I pause briefly, trying to think of what else to say, and then continue, "And I came because I have had an experience which... I don't know if I should call it a vision, or a dream, or something else entirely, but..." I stop there, unsure what to do next.
He smiles reassuringly at me, and asks, "Go ahead, please tell me more."
So I proceed, telling him everything that happened last night, including the odd feeling of having been watched by someone unseen, and also the images that I saw. When I finish describing those things, he looks thoughtful, pursing his lips slightly before responding, "You've certainly experienced quite an extraordinary event. You describe seeing people who were not actually present. That would indicate a complex hallucination, perhaps even one involving dissociative fugue. Is that correct?"
I nod slowly, "Yes sir. It's exactly right."
"Hmmm. Well, let's start with a history. Do you mind if I ask a few questions? No need to answer any question that makes you uncomfortable, just keep in mind that this will be confidential information between us, unless I determine otherwise," he begins, and I nod again.
Dr. Szozas proceeds to inquire about my childhood, and about my family, friends, work, health issues, and other personal details that I'd rather not discuss with strangers. I give him all the answers that I can recall, but I feel that I am being judged somehow, that I am failing to impress him or to live up to his expectations, but I'm too nervous to care about that now. The session goes on until I am exhausted, and I'm relieved when it is time to leave.
As we walk out into the hallway together, Dr. Szozas stops me, turns me around, and kisses me softly on the cheek. I am stunned, and I am confused

My name is Mary Beth."
He nods, then asks, "And why are you here?"
I feel myself getting flustered, embarrassed by this man asking such personal questions, "Well, because I've been having trouble sleeping lately."
"How long have you had insomnia?" he inquires.
"About three weeks now," I answer honestly.
"Three weeks? That's quite a while," he comments.
"Yes, sir, it is," I agree.
"What kinds of things do you find disturbing?" he asks.
"Everything. I can't seem to get away from bad thoughts, or unpleasant feelings. It's driving me crazy," I explain.
"Do you experience any hallucinations?" he asks.
"No," I say.
"Have you tried meditation? Or yoga?" he queries.
"Not really," I admit.
"Would you describe your sleep habits as normal?" he asks.
"Normal? No, I don't think they are," I state, feeling slightly uncomfortable with the question.
"You're not sleepy during the day?" he probes further.
"Sometimes I am, yes, but only when I'm busy doing something else, or just taking a nap," I reply.
"When was the last time that you were able to go to bed at a reasonable hour?" he continues.
"Last night I was up until 2am watching TV," I tell him, and I start to blush again.
"That was very late," he observes, "but I understand that there are some people who are unable to go to sleep before midnight."
"Yes, I know that I am one of those people," I acknowledge, "and I was up all night. I was trying to watch a movie, but I kept waking up to pee, and I couldn't focus. I was so tired I thought I would pass out if I didn't stop. I felt

My name is Emily Riddell."
He nods encouragingly, and then asks, "Emily? What does 'Emily' stand for?"
I blush slightly, because I don't want to tell this stranger my middle name. But he already knows my last name, and I suppose he will find out eventually...
So I say, "It stands for Elizabeth Anne Mary."
He smiles broadly again, and leans back in his chair, folding his hands together. He looks at me intently, and I feel compelled to continue talking to him, "I've been seeing a therapist before, but she couldn't help me. She said there was nothing wrong with me. That I just needed to work harder or something, and I didn't believe her."
Dr. Szozas listens attentively, nodding occasionally as I speak. When I finish, he sits forward, and speaks slowly, "Tell me what happened next, after you saw your previous therapist."
I sigh heavily, "Well, I went to a couple more therapists, all of them were useless. They either told me I was imagining things, that I had depression, that I should get a job, blah blah blah..."
He interrupts me, shaking his head, "That's not helpful. Tell me exactly what happened when you left each one of those sessions."
I frown, but I do as he asks, "When I left the first session with the first therapist, I got into my car, and drove home. I felt better than I did when I walked into the office. I thought I'd made a big mistake, going to that first appointment, but I decided to go anyway. I knew I would have to face the truth, whatever that might be.
"The second time I went to the therapist's office, I parked the car, and I sat in the waiting room until the appointment. I tried to read a magazine, but I kept thinking about the first meeting.

My name is Julia."
He nods, "Yes, Julia, go ahead."
So I tell him my story:
It all started after I got married last year, to this guy named Mark. We've been together since high school, we were friends before then. It was a whirlwind romance. I don't know if I can say 'love', because there wasn't any time for anything else. But I do believe we had feelings for each other, even though it seemed crazy to think that way about a boy you'd known forever. And it worked out great, right? Not really...not yet anyway.
Mark was always very attentive and affectionate toward me, but I just felt invisible sometimes. He didn't talk much about himself or what he did during the day, except that he was working hard to support us. In fact, I found myself doing most of the talking. There were times when I would ask him questions about where he was from or what he liked to do, but he never gave me many details. If I wanted something done, I usually asked him if he thought it was a good idea, and he would agree without question. Sometimes I would try to get more information out of him by asking about his hobbies or interests, but that usually resulted in a "what?" followed by an awkward pause while I tried to figure out what I should be saying next.
When I asked him about our wedding plans, I remember him looking at me and smiling. "We'll have to wait until things settle down," he said. "Things are still pretty chaotic at work. I'm trying to find a new job now that I'm unemployed, but I'm having trouble finding a position that will give me enough to live comfortably. I need to save up some money first, and I'm not sure how long that will take."
At first I was happy that he seemed to be taking his marriage responsibilities seriously. I mean, I knew that he

My name is Kate MacKenzie." And then I pause, waiting to hear what he will say next. But nothing more happens. The silence grows awkward, and I feel uncomfortable under this scrutiny. My cheeks flush slightly, and I shift uncomfortably on the couch. I wish I had something better to do than just wait there while he stares at me.
After several minutes have passed, Dr. Szozas breaks the silence, "Kate... would you mind telling me where you live?"
Oh god. What did I get myself into? I don't want to tell anyone where I live! Why can't I remember anything? It feels wrong to answer him. "Well..." I begin tentatively, "...I live in a town called Aislinn House."
He nods, and looks thoughtful for a moment. "And what does Mr. Henry James think about all this?"
Oh shit. How the hell should I know? "Um... well, he doesn't really seem to care one way or another about it. He said that if I wanted to keep seeing him, then I could continue doing that. That was after I'd already decided to stop coming by his house altogether."
Dr. Szozas smiles again. His teeth are white, and straight, and perfect. "So, you've been visiting the old man regularly, since the beginning of October?"
"Yes, I guess so. I mean, I haven't actually seen him in person yet. I only saw his face once at a distance."
He nods knowingly, and continues to look at me with his gentle eyes. I'm starting to sweat now, and I'm feeling a little ill. I'm not sure I'm ready to talk about this, but I suppose I'll have to.
"Um, I'm sorry, but I'm having trouble remembering things lately. I'm afraid I might be going crazy. I'm worried about that because I might be
