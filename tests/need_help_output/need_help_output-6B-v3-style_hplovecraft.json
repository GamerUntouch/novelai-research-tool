Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

But Dr. Szozas nods approvingly, then asks, \"And why do we meet?\"\nHe looks at me expectantly, waiting for my answer. It is hard to find words. I want to tell him that I feel weird, and that something is wrong with me, but I can't quite put those feelings into words. Instead I settle for saying, \"I think... I may have been abducted by aliens.\"\nDr. Szozas laughs. He leans back against his chair, putting his hands together under his chin, and chuckles, \"That's good enough reason for any visit!\" His laugh continues until he gets control of himself, and his face turns serious again. \"Tell me what happened,\" he prompts.\nSo I begin telling him about the abduction, and how it felt, and all the things I've seen since. I'm surprised when I finish describing the whole experience, because I realize that Dr. Szozas is not laughing anymore. In fact, he's staring at me intently, and his expression is one of deep concern. When I finish the story, he sits forward, elbows resting on his knees, \"Do you mind if I ask a few questions? Just to get the facts straight. What year were you born?\"\n\"1946.\"\n\"You don't remember being taken before, or anything about the time leading up to the event itself?\"\n\"No, nothing.

One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.
