He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",

Please tell me something about yourself.\"\nSo I start talking. And this is what I say...\nChapter 2: The Girl Who Loved Money\n* * *\nI grew up in a town called New Jerusalem, which is located in a small farming community near the southern border of the Kingdom of Winfiel. We were a poor family, but I had a good upbringing nonetheless. I was raised by a single mother after my parents passed away when I was young. She worked hard to raise us both and never let us go hungry. \nWhen I turned ten years old, she got sick, and her condition deteriorated rapidly. It was clear that she would not survive much longer, so I decided I needed to move out. I found a job at a bakery and saved up enough money to pay for my own room and board. I moved into an apartment in the city, where I found work at a clothing store. I didn't have a lot of friends there, since most of them were the sons and daughters of the wealthy. I did find one friend, a girl named Elin, though.\nShe was very pretty and sweet, and I enjoyed spending time with her. Our relationship became more than just friendship, however; I started to feel a little guilty because I was dating a younger woman. I wasn't sure if that made me a bad person or not.\nElin also liked to gamble; I don't think she knew how to handle the odds well, but she loved playing the lottery. That is when I learned that the price for a ticket is five gold coins. I remember being shocked at the cost, and then I asked her if I could buy a few tickets for myself. I won three times, and I thought I was a lucky man.\nI wanted to celebrate my luck and",

He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

  "prompt": "I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",
  "result": "My name is Lawrence.\"\nHe nods, and then responds, \"And?\"\nIt feels strange being asked such questions, but I answer, \"And...I've been having problems sleeping lately.\"\n\"Anything unusual happening? Any changes in lifestyle? What time do you usually go to bed each night? Do you have any trouble falling asleep?\"\nI tell him what I can remember about my sleep cycle, and I explain that I had gotten used to getting up at 6am, but recently I'd fallen back to waking up at 7 or 8am instead.\n\"Do you find yourself feeling tired during the day?\"\nI nod.\n\"You don't feel sleepy at all after dinner, correct?\"\nAgain I nod.   \"Have you ever heard of a condition called narcolepsy?\"\nI shake my head.\n\"Narcolepsy is a disorder where the brain stops functioning properly, causing the body to stop producing melatonin. The problem is, that the mind does not get enough rest and the person falls asleep at inappropriate times. In addition to this, the patient may experience sudden and uncontrollable episodes of muscle weakness and paralysis, known as cataplexy.\nIf you think that sounds scary, I agree. It is indeed a terrifying disease, and many people die from it. However, there is a treatment, and I will be able to cure you. Now, I want to ask you a few things. How old are you?\"\nI am a little surprised by the question. I hadn't thought much past the fact that I was a young adult. I reply, \"Twenty-one. Why is that important?\"\nDr. Szozas smiles, \"I'm just making sure we understand one another. I need to know a few more details before I begin the process. Please, tell me when you were born. You mentioned you have a younger sister, and she is seventeen, right?\"\nI nod,",
