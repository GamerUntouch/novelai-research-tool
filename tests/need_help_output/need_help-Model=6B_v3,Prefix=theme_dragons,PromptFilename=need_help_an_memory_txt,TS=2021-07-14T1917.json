  "prompt": "I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",
  "result": "My name is Taryn, and I'm afraid.\"\nHe looks puzzled, then inquisitively curious, \"Afraid? Of what?\"\n\"Of being different, and not fitting in,\" I say quietly.\nHe nods, \"I understand completely. It can be very isolating to feel alienated, especially since we've all grown up together. We have shared experiences, and yet each of us had our own unique life path. And now, suddenly, we find ourselves thrust into this strange new world where we don't know anyone, or what they think about anything. I remember feeling just like you did when I was in high school.   But I also remember that there were others who didn't feel quite the same way, and eventually I learned to accept them for their differences.\"\nI nod, \"I guess I haven't been able to do that.\"\n\"Why is that?\"\nI shrug, \"It doesn't seem right somehow. I should want the best for everyone else, but I don't. I wish I understood myself better, but I'm not sure I even know myself well enough to try to understand the people I meet. I keep trying though, because I care, but I always fail. I'm not sure I'll ever get a handle on it, and I hate to admit it, but I sometimes wonder if I will end up alone, like my parents. I would never hurt another person intentionally, I really wouldn't. But I might not be able to stop myself from doing something I'd regret later.\"\nDr. Szozas smiles, \"I appreciate the honesty, but I believe that you are capable of understanding and accepting those around you. I'm sure if you put in the effort, you will come to terms with your situation. You may be a little more difficult than the average teenager to deal with, but I'm confident you can overcome any obstacles. What is it you're afraid of?\"\nI sigh",

I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

  "prompt": "I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",
  "result": "My name is Pigeon, and I have been experiencing strange feelings lately.\"\nHe raises his eyebrows, \"Strange feelings?\"\n\"Yes, I've had this feeling since last week, when I saw a movie called 'A Star Is Born'. It's about a singer named Jackson Maine, played by Bradley Cooper, who falls in love with an actress named Ally McBeal, played by Lady Gaga. They both have a lot of issues, but they overcome them together, and then they become famous.  It was really good, I liked it very much. But after watching the movie, something happened to me.\"\nDr. Szozas listens intently, and nods his head in encouragement as I continue.\n\"After the movie ended, there were all kinds of emotions inside of me. I felt happy for the two main characters because they overcame their problems. I also felt sad for the other actors in the film, for the people that they hurt along the way. I even felt angry at the studio for making such a terrible movie. And I felt jealous that I couldn't sing or act or anything else, and I wanted to be just like the beautiful Lady Gaga character, I wanted her fame and fortune. I even thought about killing myself, and I actually did kill myself once. I don't know if I can explain any better than that.\"\nI pause, and wait for his response, and his eyes are locked onto mine. I feel his gaze, and I am drawn into his eyes, his eyes are bright and sparkling, \"You didn't kill yourself, Pigeon,\" he says softly, \"that's not what I meant at all. You're a wonderful person, and I think you should go on living. I'm sorry if I seemed to imply otherwise.\"\nI smile, \"Thank you, Dr. Szozas. I guess I'm a bit embarrassed, and I'd rather be honest. I'm nervous to tell you",
