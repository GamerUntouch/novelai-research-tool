  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Jennifer.\"\nHe nods, \"And why did you decide to seek counseling?\"\n\"Well, I've been having trouble sleeping lately...\" I say quietly.\n\"What sort of problems have you had with sleep? Have they caused any other symptoms?\" he asks, leaning forward slightly.\nI shrug, \"It varies...sometimes I can't get to sleep, sometimes I wake up early, sometimes I just feel tired all day long. It's not really a problem yet, but I think it might become one soon. And there are times when I don't know what time it is, or where I am.\"\n\"Have you ever experienced anything similar before?\"\n\"No, never. But I do remember feeling very confused once, when I was younger. I felt like I couldn't control myself, and things were happening without warning or explanation. That sounds pretty bad, huh?\" I ask hopefully.\nDr. Szozas smiles, \"Not at all. Your memories are not unusual, and while those feelings may persist, they will pass eventually. You should try to relax more often, though -- it helps to calm the mind, and to allow us to focus better.\" He stands up again, and comes back to his chair, \"Now tell me about this dream you mentioned earlier -- what happened?\"\nSo I describe the dream, and how it made me feel. Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding occasionally, asking questions, and writing notes in his little notebook. When I finish, he looks at me thoughtfully, then he gets out his phone, and starts making calls. After a few minutes, he puts his phone away, and turns to me with a smile, \"You seem to be experiencing some mild anxiety -- which is perfectly normal, given that your life is changing rapidly -- but we'll be able to help with that too. Now, let me review the information I gathered from your web search -- please correct me if",

I guess that's normal enough behavior. Anyway, after a few years, Mom decided to try for another baby, but that ended badly. She went through three miscarriages, and finally gave up. After that, she became depressed, stopped eating properly, lost weight, and her hair fell out. She looked terrible. Her boyfriend left her, saying that she'd changed too much. Then one day, she just disappeared. I never heard from her again. I'm not sure if she's alive, dead, or somewhere else.\n\"After that, I lived with my grandparents until I graduated high school. I",

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

Finally, I decide to just dive right in, \"Well, I think something is wrong with me.\" I try to keep eye contact with him, but I find myself staring at his lips instead.\nHe nods slowly, \"That makes sense. What do you feel?\"\n\"Um...well...\" I trail off, trying to organize my thoughts. It feels weird talking about myself, especially since I don't know what is normal. But I have to tell somebody, and maybe Dr. Szazas can help me figure things out. \"It's hard to explain. Like, sometimes I get really horny all of a sudden, without any reason, and then other times I'm not even aware of being aroused. And there are days when I masturbate several times during the day, and then there are others where nothing happens. Sometimes I wake up with an erection, but I never remember having one before waking up. When I was younger, I had sex with my boyfriends, but now I've been celibate for years. My breasts are very sensitive, and they seem to be getting bigger lately. They used to be small, but recently they've gotten larger, and I can't wear bras anymore because they hurt too much. I've tried wearing t-shirts, but that doesn't work either.\"\nDr. Szozas smiles at me, and his face lights up with amusement, \"Oh, that sounds interesting. Can I ask you some questions? You said that you are feeling 'horny', but are you experiencing pleasure, or pain?\"\n\"Both. Pleasure mostly. Pain only occasionally.\"\n\"Have you ever experienced anything like that before, with your hands, say, or with a vibrator, or with another person?\"\n\"No, never.\"\n\"What about with your partner?\"\n\"Yes, we did that",
