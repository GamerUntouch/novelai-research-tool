Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Amy.\"\nHe nods, waiting patiently. \"And why are you here?\" he asks again.\nIt feels strange to tell this stranger all about myself. But it also feels good to talk about it. It helps to get it off my chest. \"Well... it started last year, when I went to visit my sister. She lives right outside of Boston. We'd been talking online for years, and she had just gotten engaged to her boyfriend. When I visited them, they were getting ready to go out to dinner with their friends. And then...\" I pause, feeling embarrassed. \"Then something happened that I can't explain, or even describe properly. Things got very weird. My sister didn't recognize me anymore. Her fiancee thought I was a total stranger, and I felt awkward, uncomfortable, like I wasn't really there. Like I was invisible. That night we stayed up late watching TV, and I couldn't sleep because I was so worried about what would happen next time I saw her. The next day, I left early to drive home, but when I arrived at our house, my parents said that they hadn't seen me since the previous week. They assumed I was out with a friend. I tried to call my sister, but I couldn't reach her; I don't know if she turned her phone off, or if she forgot to charge it, but I never heard back from her. I drove to her fiancÃ©'s place to try to find her, but I couldn't find any trace of her anywhere. I finally called the police, and reported her missing. I was the only one who knew where to look for her.\n\"They asked me lots of questions, but I told them I didn't have the slightest idea what might have happened. I guess I must have looked pretty upset, because the detective suggested I come to the station to file a report. I agreed to do that, but I kept thinking about the",
