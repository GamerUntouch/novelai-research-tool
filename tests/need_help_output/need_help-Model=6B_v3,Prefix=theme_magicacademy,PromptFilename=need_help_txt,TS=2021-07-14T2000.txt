=== Prompt ========================================
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "

=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Zabini." I pause again before continuing, "Alexandra... uh..." I don't know what to call myself now. It feels wrong somehow to use my real last name, but it's also too long. I can shorten it easily enough, but there's something more important than just being shorter.
"Your middle name?" He prompts gently, and I think briefly about my parents' wishes. My father wanted to honor them by naming me after his mother, while my mother wanted to honor her father, thus they split their votes between 'Zabini', which honors both sides of my heritage, and 'Carruthers', which honors my paternal grandfather. But ultimately my mom won out, because she had been named after her grandmother â€“ a woman that she loved very much, and I thought was beautiful.
So I answer, "Anna Maria," then add, "and I came here today to talk about what happened earlier this week."
Dr. Szozas nods, and asks me to tell him all about it.
As I recount the events of Tuesday morning, I feel that I'm telling a stranger about a particularly distressing dream. The details seem strange to me, but I believe that I am remembering accurately. I am surprised to find that I am able to describe the entire incident so clearly, even though I was terrified to go through with it.
After I finish describing the incident to Dr. Szozas, I wait expectantly for his reaction. He sits quietly, and ponders the story, thinking deeply about the various possibilities that I have presented.
Finally, Dr. Szozas speaks, "It sounds to me like you were under extreme stress at the time of the incident, Alexandra. You were scared out of your mind, and I doubt that you fully understood the consequences of the actions that you took. As a result, I suspect that the trauma that you experienced was a form of post-traumatic

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Zabrisk."
He nods, and then asks, "And why do you think you're here?"
"Well..." I begin, "It started two weeks ago when I got this really bad headache... It just wouldn't go away. My vision became blurry, and I couldn't focus on anything, except maybe one word in front of another. And my stomach hurt. The pain was excruciating, and I felt sick all day long, and I had trouble sleeping."
"OK, now tell me what happened next," he prompts.
So I continue, "That night I went to bed early, because I knew that if I stayed up any longer I would get worse, so I took Tylenol PMs, and I slept until 7am. When I woke up, I found myself unable to move; I tried to wake up, but nothing worked. I was frozen, paralyzed. Everything seemed hazy, fuzzy, hard to comprehend."
"What did you do?"
"Well I panicked a little, and called 911, but they said that I was fine, and they sent me home. But by the time I arrived back at my apartment, things were getting much worse; I couldn't even stand up straight anymore. I was lying on the floor, and I kept seeing stars before my eyes, and I heard voices saying 'wake up', but I didn't want to wake up; I wanted to sleep forever. I cried out to God to help me, but I don't know if he answered. I lay there crying out to God, but no answer came. I laid there, thinking I'd never be able to walk again, I thought I'd die, I almost died. I prayed that I would pass out, and I hoped that when I awoke, I would be a better person. I hated myself. I cursed at the world, at the universe, at fate itself, at everything that ever caused me

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Jennings."
He nods knowingly, then says, "Alexandra? What do you think your problem might be?"
"Well... uh..." I stutter, trying to decide where to begin. "It all started after we moved here two years ago," I explain.
"Where did you move from?"
"New York City."
"And what happened there?"
"We were both born here, and lived our whole lives here until moving to this new city. We had been living together for three months, and we'd just gotten engaged."
"So you've known each other long enough to get married, but not long enough to know what was wrong with you?"
"Exactly!"
Dr. Szozas smiles again, "That sounds normal to me. That makes sense. Now tell me about the events leading up to the last few days."
I recount the story: I was feeling great, I thought everything was fine; then I got sick. My body felt funny, I couldn't breathe right, I lost weight, my hair fell out, and I grew fur. And I became very aggressive, violent even, almost killing myself.
Dr. Szosas asks me to elaborate.
"You know about the incident with the car accident, the one that killed the woman I loved?" I ask.
"Yes, I read about that. You caused an accident because you suddenly went crazy, didn't you?"
"No, I don't think I'm insane," I say quietly. "I'm pretty sure I'm still sane."
"But you have no idea why you are acting the way you are now. Why is that?"
"There's something different about me that I can't quite put into words yet. I feel like I'm losing control, but I don't understand why I would lose control. I'm scared. I need help." I look at the doctor with pleading eyes.

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Harris."
He nods, "And tell me what brings you here today?"
So I begin: "Well, I've been having trouble sleeping lately... I just can't seem to get myself to sleep..."
Dr. Szozas smiles sympathetically, "You know what? We have all kinds of problems at night sometimes, we go through stages where we try different things, we don't want to wake our partner or spouse, we may think of something exciting, and then we realize that there's nothing else to do but lie awake until morning. It happens to everyone eventually."
"Yes, yes, I suppose it does," I say, nodding along with his words.
"What sort of things do you worry about during the day?"
"Um, well, I guess I just feel anxious, or I have nightmares, or I feel depressed, and I lose track of time, and I forget to eat, and um..."
Dr. Szozas cuts me off mid-sentence, "Alexandra, I'm not sure if this will help you at all, but I believe that many people with mental health issues find their lives easier when they start to talk about them out loud. You might find that writing about your concerns helps to alleviate some of those worries, because by talking about them out loud, you'll be able to better understand them. And I'd be happy to listen to whatever you have to say."
Wow! I thought, I hadn't expected that at all. I had assumed that I would be asked to fill out questionnaires, and I was expecting to be evaluated somehow. But I felt a little relieved that I didn't need to be examined physically; maybe I was being paranoid.
"Thank you, Doctor, I appreciate that very much. I was hoping that I could talk about some of the issues that I've been experiencing, and that I could possibly work out a plan to deal with

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Harris." I pause, wondering where this goes next...
He smiles broadly, "Alexandra, please continue..."
So I tell him all about myself: I've been having trouble sleeping since last year, nightmares mostly involving people killing each other. It used to be just bad dreams, but now they seem more real than any dream ever was. They involve my father, sometimes my mother, sometimes strangers, always blood everywhere. Sometimes I wake up screaming, crying, feeling sick, almost nauseous. And then there are the voices in my head telling me things, whispering horrible secrets, telling me terrible truths, making promises that will never come true. The worst part is that I can't remember them when I awake. But even worse are the feelings that accompany those memories, the rage, the hatred, the fear, the helplessness.
And I tell him about the website I found, the one that suggested I come here.
Dr. Szozas listens intently to everything I say, nodding occasionally when I mention something new. When I finish, he asks me to stand up, walk around the room a few times, talk about what I feel.
After a moment, he tells me to get back on the couch. "Can I ask you a question?" he inquires gently.
"Yes sir!" I reply enthusiastically.
"What do you think about the idea that you might have a problem with sleep?"
"Well, I don't know if I'm crazy or not, but I am sure that I'm not imagining these things that are happening to me!" I protest.
"How long has it been since you noticed the problems with your sleep? How much time did you spend worrying about it before coming to me today?"
"About a month, I guess. I tried reading books about insomnia, but I couldn't concentrate. I started thinking about trying some medication, but I decided to wait until I talked to a

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Harris."
He nods, and then asks, "And why did you seek help?"
I tell him, "I've been having trouble sleeping lately... I can't seem to get any restful sleep, even though I'm exhausted after working all day. And I have nightmares sometimes..."
Dr. Szozas smiles, "How long has this been happening?"
"For several weeks now," I answer.
He leans forward, and rests his elbows on his knees, "Have you ever considered taking medication? There may be something that will help you relax more easily."
"No," I shake my head adamantly. I feel a little defensive about the subject, but I know there's nothing wrong with trying medication if it works. "But I want to try talking about it instead. Is that alright?"
"Of course," he responds. "We'll start by getting you comfortable enough to talk about what's bothering you. Please describe your dreams or visions."
So I do. I tell him about the strange dream where I saw myself being chased through the forest, and about the weird vision that I had when I was a kid, watching people die horribly at night.
Dr. Szozas listens intently, occasionally asking questions to clarify details. When I finish describing the nightmare I had last week, he tells me that I should try to go back to bed tonight, and that I shouldn't worry about the dreams until morning.
When I leave his office, I am feeling better than I have felt in days. I walk out into the bright sunshine, and I breathe deeply, enjoying the air on my face. The sun feels good on my shoulders, warming me up.
As I'm walking home from the doctor, I think about the way he looked at me with those kind, intelligent eyes, and I wonder if I'm imagining things about his looks. But I still feel that I might be falling in love with

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Zabrisk." My heart flutters a little inside me, my palms sweat slightly, and I have trouble finding the right words.
He nods thoughtfully, "Yes, I've heard of you. You were featured in one of the news stories recently. The 'Missing Princess'. Do you want to tell me about that?"
I nod. And then I begin to talk: "It all started last summer...   It was a few weeks after my 18th birthday. I had just graduated high school, and I went off to college at MIT, and I was really excited because I'd gotten accepted there. That night, I got back home late, and I walked into the house where I grew up, and I saw mom and dad sitting together at the kitchen table. They looked up at me when they noticed I was home, and they smiled at me. It felt weird to walk in on them like this, I guess I expected them to be doing something else. But nothing seemed out of the ordinary. We talked about stuff, we caught up, I helped with dinner, things like that. Dad even gave me a hug before bedtime."
Dr. Szozas leans forward attentively, "And what did you think when you found them? Did anything seem odd or wrong to you?"
I pause to collect myself again, "No. Nothing at first. Then I realized that I hadn't seen them much lately, that I didn't hear from either of them very often. I wondered if I should call or email them, but I never found the time. I was too busy with classes and work and friends..." I trail off, and I look at the floor. I feel awkward talking about it now, but I need to get it out somehow.
"So I was wondering if I was losing my mind. I was thinking about that a lot. I was worried that I might be going crazy, or that I wasn

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Zabrisk."
He nods, and then looks back at me expectantly, waiting.
I continue, "And I came because..." I pause again, and think about what I should say next...
Then I blurt out, "Because I feel different inside than I did before Hogwarts began!"
Dr. Szozas raises one eyebrow slightly, and tilts his head sideways, quizzically, "Different? How do you define 'different'? Do you have any symptoms?"
I shake my head slowly, "No, not really. It feels like there's something missing from within me, or maybe it's just that I've been disconnected from myself. I don't know what else to call it."
Dr. Szozas leans forward, and places both elbows onto his knees, "You mentioned feeling different â€“ do you remember when this started happening?"
I nod, "Yeah, last week, after we got to Diagon Alley. I felt strange, out of sorts, like I was losing control of my thoughts and emotions. I tried talking to Hermione Granger, but she couldn't help me either."
"Hmm, I understand that you were worried about her, but perhaps I can shed some light on this situation. Did anything happen while you were at Hogwarts that may be related to this change in behavior?" He asks.
I think hard about the events that occurred during our trip to London. We had spent the first day walking around the city, seeing all the famous tourist attractions. After that, we visited the Leaky Cauldron, where Harry Potter purchased a drink called Butterbeer. The second night, we stayed at the Three Broomsticks Inn, a pub near the Ministry of Magic headquarters. I recall having a few drinks with the rest of the Gryffindor girls, but nothing particularly unusual happened that evening.
After that, I went to bed early, but I woke up the following morning with a splitting

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Alexandra Zabrisk." My heart pounds in my chest, and I feel a rush of excitement fill me. I've never spoken this much before. The words just pour out of me:
"Well, um...I guess I don't really know where to start..."
He nods kindly, "That sounds good enough." And then he pauses, and looks at me expectantly, waiting for me to continue. I begin again, trying to get it all out.
"I think maybe there's something wrong with me. Something very wrong indeed. It started about two weeks ago. First, I had trouble concentrating, which is unusual for me. But I wasn't getting anything done, even though I tried hard. I felt exhausted. I kept thinking about things that weren't important, and couldn't remember what I'd been doing half an hour earlier. Sometimes I would try to do work assignments, and I wouldn't understand them. Or sometimes I didn't even want to do the assignment; it was too difficult or boring. That's when I realized that I was having trouble with reading comprehension â€“ I found myself skimming through pages, not actually understanding what the author meant to say. I began to have dreams that I thought were real. They seemed to be connected somehow to my current situation, but I can't figure out how they are related to each other."
Dr. Szozas listens intently to me, nodding his head occasionally to indicate that I'm making sense. He asks me to go back to the beginning. I tell him about the first day I noticed that I was losing focus. I describe how I became tired, and sleepy, but I still managed to get some work done. I'm surprised by the intensity with which I talk about this stuff. I'm feeling more relaxed, less anxious, and I'm telling him about the dreams I'm experiencing. I'm describing the dream that I woke up from that morning, and how I

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Alexandra Zabrisk."
He smiles again, "And why do we have this meeting?"
This time I answer more confidently, "Because I've been having strange dreams lately, and I think they might be related to magical forces. And I need help figuring out what's happening to me."
Dr. Szozas nods encouragingly. "That sounds very reasonable. Do you know where these dreams started? Were there any triggers, anything that precipitated them?"
I shake my head, "No, nothing specific. They just suddenly started after school one day."
"Are you experiencing other changes besides the dream episodes?" he asks gently.
Again I nod, "Yes. My magic is stronger than normal, I can feel things coming together inside me, and I... I don't want to hurt anyone anymore. It feels wrong to use my powers to harm people."
Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair, taking a moment to consider this information, "Well, let's start by getting an idea of exactly when the change began. How old are you, Alex?"
"Nineteen years old."
"Any family history of mental illness or substance abuse problems? Any medical conditions that would cause stress or anxiety?"
I shrug, "None that I'm aware of. I'm healthy, I'm a little overweight, but I eat well and exercise regularly."
"Alexandra, I'm going to ask you to close your eyes now, and relax. Don't worry if you hear me talking; I'll stop if I sense that you are uncomfortable. Please try to get a good night's sleep tonight, and I will contact you tomorrow morning at 9:30am to schedule our appointment. Thank you, Alex, I look forward to speaking with you soon."

When I wake up the next morning I am a bit groggy, but I remember the conversation I had with Dr. Szozas
