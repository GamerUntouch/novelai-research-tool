=== Prompt ========================================
I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.

[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "


=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Aqsa, and I've been having problems." I pause, then continue, "And I don't know if they're normal, or abnormal, but I think I might have something wrong with my brain. It feels like there is a lot more happening than usual. And sometimes I get confused about things, or feel dizzy.   Sometimes I can't remember anything after waking up." I sigh, and shake my head, "It's hard to explain."
Dr. Szozas nods, and looks thoughtful, "Can you tell me what kinds of symptoms you experience?"
I try to summarize all the feelings and sensations that I have experienced, trying to put them into words. I begin by describing my headaches, which I say come on a regular basis, maybe once or twice a week. I also describe the strange feelings of disorientation I occasionally experience, and the confusion I feel when I wake up or go to sleep. I mention the occasional difficulty concentrating, or the loss of short-term memory, and the fact that I often forget names and faces. I speak of the feeling I sometimes have that I am not myself, and the way I sometimes become anxious and fearful.
I conclude my summary, "I don't know if this is normal, or not, but I think it is unusual. Sometimes I just want to cry and scream, or throw up or punch somebody." I stare at the floor, "But I haven't done any of those things yet."
He smiles gently, "Thank you for telling me your story; I appreciate hearing from people who are experiencing unusual symptoms. I will need to discuss the details with you in order to determine if we should schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have a phone number where I may contact you?
I give him my cell phone number, and I ask for his email address, and I write out my home address on the back of an old business card.


=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Ayla Jorgenson."
He nods. "A good start. Please tell me about this issue that you're having, or what you think may be causing this problem?"
I begin slowly, carefully, but then I realize that there is no need to hold back. My story spills forth, describing my life in great detail, starting with my childhood and finishing with the present moment. When I finish, I feel drained, exhausted, relieved, and yet... something is missing. There is still a hole inside of me, and I don't know what to do or say next.
Dr. Szozas sits quietly for a while, just watching me, "So that is your story. Now I have to ask myself a question: Am I qualified to help you? I can understand your fear; I've been in the same position before. I would advise against seeing a counselor unless you really want to go through the process. I will give you my honest opinion, which is that I believe you are experiencing a significant amount of anxiety, and I suspect that the cause is the change in your diet.  I also suspect that you might be suffering from depression, and I am concerned that the stress is affecting your work performance. I recommend a few sessions, and I will try to get you into a group therapy session. I'll email you the details, and I hope you will consider my recommendation. I wish I had better news for you. Good luck to you, Ayla."
I thank him, and I stand up and leave.
I walk out into the lobby, and I wonder if I should call the doctor. I decide not to. I'm too embarrassed. I find a coffee shop, and I order a latte and a sandwich, and I eat both. I enjoy the food, and I savor the taste. The latte is very strong, and the flavor is sweet, and I sip at the warm,

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Jai Dixit." I pause again, wondering if I should tell him about the issues I've been dealing with, but I decide against it, after all, this isn't therapy, just a consultation.  So instead, I continue, "I have a problem. It started about two years ago, when I began experiencing feelings of inferiority, insecurity, anger, jealousy, resentment... I felt very depressed, hopeless, and lost, and I couldn't figure out what was wrong with me. I would get angry at everyone for no reason, even my own family members. And then one day I had a fight with my wife, and we broke up. She moved out of our apartment, took most of her things, but left a few small items behind, including a picture frame, which she'd bought for us, a silver wedding anniversary gift. I went through the rest of the stuff in the house, and found the framed photo. I knew that I loved my ex-wife, and I didn't want to hurt her, so I put the frame back where I found it. I thought that I was doing the right thing, that I was being considerate and thoughtful for my soon-to-be-ex-spouse. But the next morning, when I woke up, I saw the photograph. I noticed something strange; the woman in the photo wasn't my wife anymore. I looked closer, and I realized that the woman in the photo was a younger version of my wife. I recognized the woman in the photo as my first girlfriend when I was in college. I remembered the date on the calendar, and the fact that I hadn't seen my old flame since I graduated. I tried to reach out to my former lover, and I sent an email, but I never received a reply. I tried calling, too, and I got voicemail messages from my ex-girlfriend. I called my current wife, and I asked her

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Ayla."   I feel silly saying this, but it feels good to say it. The truth is, I don't know what my real name is anymore. My mother died before I was born, and my father took another wife after her death. I have only vague memories of my biological mother. She had a different last name than mine, but she was always very nice to me. I remember that she used to sing me songs and tell me stories, and sometimes we would play games together.   But those times were few and far between because my father wasn't too keen on sharing me with anyone else.
After I was born, my father remarried again, and now I live in a small village called Balshang. It is located near the city of Kvatch, which is where I work as a tailor. I've been there for three years, and I can't wait to move out of my parents' house. I want to go to college, maybe study medicine, and become a doctor. I also want to travel the world and experience life. I've never left the country of Morrowind, and I'd really like to do that.
Dr. Szozas nods, and then continues to ask questions, "So, what brings you to my office today?"
I pause, and think about the question. I've gone through a lot, and I haven't gotten any help, or even a referral for that matter. I thought I might try a psychiatrist, I really need to get better, and I think my problem may be related to my past.
"Well, Doctor, my situation has got to the point where it's causing problems in my personal and professional life. I am not sure if my condition is a result of my childhood, my current living environment, my upbringing, my genes, my family history, my genetics, my culture, or my society, and I just don't know

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Kim."
He nods, and looks back at his computer screen for a moment before speaking again, "Kim, do you have any idea what brought you here?"
I shake my head 'no', and then I realize that I've been staring at him while he waited for my answer.  I clear my throat, and speak again, "I don't know what I need help with exactly, but I think I might be depressed."
Dr. Szozas smiles at me, and leans forward in his chair, "Do you want to tell me about that? I can assure you that whatever is troubling you is not unique. In fact, I would say that depression is very common among people today. Why don't we start by talking about when you feel the most depressed, and when things get better for you. We'll go through a series of questions and I will try to determine if there are any patterns to your feelings and behavior. Is this ok with you, Kim?"
I nod, and I begin. I describe the symptoms I experience when I am feeling the worst; the fatigue, the lack of motivation, the difficulty concentrating, the irritability, the sense of hopelessness, the inability to sleep. I also mention the other times when I feel good; the periods when I seem to enjoy life and my relationships with friends and family; the moments when I feel happy and excited.
Dr. Szozas asks a few clarifying questions, and I offer more details when I remember them; I explain the relationship between my husband and I, and I talk about my children and my grandchildren. I even share my thoughts on the state of the world, and the recent elections.
I'm surprised when I hear myself saying, "I'm really worried about the future, and my kids. I just hope they aren't going to turn out like us. It's scary, and I'm afraid I may lose control.
I expect

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Ayla." 
He nods, "And what brings you to my office today?"
I pause again, "Well, um...I don't know where else to go, but I thought maybe..." 
"You wanted to talk about something? Something serious?"
I nod, "Yes. But before we get started, I have one question, if I may ask."
He smiles, "Go ahead, please."
I ask, "What do you think is the most important part of a relationship? The physical or emotional?"
Dr. Szozas leans back, thinking for a moment, then replies, "It depends on the individual person, doesn't it? There are many different ways people can express their affection for each other. Some find comfort in touch, others prefer verbal communication. For example, some couples enjoy making love in front of a camera for the entertainment value, while others prefer privacy. It all depends on the individuals involved, right?"
I smile, "I guess so."
He grins, "So if I were to tell you that I'm a fan of the latter, I would be lying, wouldn't I?"
I laugh, "No, I understand, I just didn't expect the answer to be that direct. I was hoping for a more roundabout way of asking the same question, not a flat out 'yes'."
He laughs, "I'd say that a good therapist will give you the straight forward answers, but if I had to choose, I think the importance of the emotional bond is paramount. I believe that a strong emotional connection is essential to a healthy and fulfilling relationship. If a couple is not emotionally connected, there is a risk that they might drift apart, and that is a very real danger. I am afraid I cannot be any clearer than this, I hope I've answered your question."
I shake my head, "I appreciate the honesty, thank you."

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Aqilah Alhazim."   I pause, trying to decide where to start. The doctor smiles, waiting patiently for me to continue. I feel foolish, but I want this to work. It feels good to tell the truth. This is all happening very fast, and I don't know if I can do this, but I have to try. My parents were killed by terrorists, and I had to leave Syria. I was able to get a scholarship to study abroad in England. I didn't really care about the school, or what they taught me there, just that it was better than being home.   I came to America because I wanted to live freely, and I thought that maybe here I would find a way to help people who needed my help. I got a job at the hospital to save money. I knew that I couldn't afford to go to college, so I figured I'd become a nurse. I've been working for a couple years now, and I'm doing well. I hope I can stay employed for a long time.
"So, Miss, um, Aqilah, let's talk about the problem at hand," the psychiatrist suggested. I nod, and begin again, "I guess I should explain a little more. I... I..."
I stop, feeling embarrassed.
He continues for me, "I think I understand. You are a young woman, and I suspect that you may be experiencing a mid-life crisis. I'll bet you haven't even met a guy yet, and you're starting to worry if you will ever meet the right person for you."
I smile at his words.
I blurt out, "Yes! Yes, that's exactly it!"
Dr. Szozas laughs, "Well, I'm glad we agree on something. So, how does a twenty-two year old female end up in my office? And, yes I'm

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Aqilah."   I pause again, wondering if I should say more, but then decide against it, "And I'm here because I have a problem."   My mind races, trying to think of what to tell this doctor. The last time I saw a therapist was in high school, and I had a very bad experience. It wasn't until college that I started seeing a psychiatrist, but I've never really liked them. They don't seem to listen or care about anything other than the symptoms they find, and I get the feeling that there isn't much depth in their analysis. But I know nothing about psychiatrists.
Dr. Szozas looks at me, "Go on."
I swallow hard, "Well, um, I guess I just want to talk about my problems. I don't feel right, I can't sleep, I'm depressed... I haven't been able to focus on anything for a while now. I've tried medication, but I hate taking pills. I always feel sick afterwards. I'd rather try something else, maybe a therapy session?"
He smiles, "So you do believe I might help you? What sort of therapy would you prefer, and what is the issue that is causing the trouble for you?"
I breathe a sigh of relief; I'm not crazy, and I'm not alone. "I don't know. I'm not sure. I suppose I'll let you figure out the best way to go about things. I just need help, I can't deal with the situation on my own anymore. I'm not even sure where to start. I was thinking of going back to the old fashioned method, talking to a priest, I used to be Catholic, and I hear the priests are good at helping people. I was also considering a shaman, I heard they were helpful too, and I know a few in my area. I'm not sure which to choose, though."

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Aqilah. I'm twenty-six years old. My father died last year after a long illness. It hit us hard financially, and I had to leave school early to go back home to work while my mother raised our younger brother and sister."   I pause, searching for the right words. I don't know if this will help him understand what I've been experiencing. I continue, "It was difficult living there alone with just mom and two kids. But we got by somehow.
Then about six months ago I started having trouble sleeping. I'd wake up in the middle of the night screaming or crying, sometimes both at once. I couldn't get to sleep because I was afraid that if I did, something horrible would happen to me during the night. The nightmares were terrible, but even worse were the feelings of dread when I woke up, knowing I wasn't dreaming anymore.
I tried talking to my family, but they didn't seem to have any idea what I meant. They said I should seek professional counseling.
So I came to Dr. Szozas, but I can't afford the fees. I thought maybe I could talk to him for free to see if I might benefit from his expertise.
Dr. Szozas listened intently, and then asked, "Have you ever felt sad? Like you want to cry, but you haven't?"
I nodded yes.
He smiled, and continued, "Have you ever wanted to do something, but you knew that doing it wouldn't solve anything, and that it probably wouldn't change things anyway, and yet still, you kept trying to find a solution, a way to make the situation better, a reason for the sadness, a cause for the tears?"
I shook my head no.
"Do you feel like you're losing control, and not being able to handle the stress and anxiety in your life, and the only thing you can think to

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Aqilah Alshayeb." I pause briefly, wondering if there is anything else I should say about myself? But then I continue, "Aqilah means 'beautiful.'  I don't know what beautiful means, but I hope it fits me. I've always been pretty, and people have complimented me all my life. I guess this is part of the reason I want help, because I'm not sure if I am a beautiful person, or if I just think I am. It feels strange to describe my own self in such a way, but maybe I can do it by describing others, instead.
I'll start with the best: my mother is a very attractive woman. She was born in the United States, and she married my father when they were both young, and moved to Saudi Arabia when my dad got a job offer. My mom is a nurse, and a school teacher, and my dad works at a small company in Riyadh. They live in a nice house, and we had a lot of nice things growing up, and I learned a lot of good values from my parents. I also learned a lot of bad ones from them.
I hate my mother for marrying my dad, and for moving us away. I hated my dad for not being more protective, for not standing up for her when I started dating boys. I hated my dad for not trying harder to be a better husband and a better provider. I hate my dad for not loving my mother and making my childhood happier. I hate my dad for getting drunk and driving home, for failing to protect my mother and our family. I hate my dad for dying.
I loved my mom, and I miss her. I wish my dad hadn't died. I feel sorry for my sister, who is only a year older than me, and I really love my little brother. I'm sure my parents are looking up at the sky right now, and
