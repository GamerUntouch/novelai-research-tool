I've never been shy before, but I feel awkward talking to this doctor. It feels strange to talk to anyone about anything personal. I had hoped to keep it private, but apparently I'm not even allowed to do that.\nDr. Szozas sits forward in his chair, leaning toward me, \"Let's start with your background. Where did you grow up? What were the circumstances surrounding your birth?\"\nOh no, I think, I should have stayed quiet about that. My mother died giving birth to me; she was only twenty-two years old. Her father raised me, but I always felt that he didn't really care about me. I went through a lot of changes when I became an adult: I got married, but it ended badly, and I lost a child, too. Now I live alone with a dog.\nI don't remember much from when I was young. I vaguely recall being taken to visit relatives; I believe I lived with them until I started school. I'm not sure if they adopted me or I was born into their family; I wasn't aware that I'd come into the world without parents.\n\"You mentioned losing a baby.
