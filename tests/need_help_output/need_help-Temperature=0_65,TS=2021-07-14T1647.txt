=== Prompt ========================================
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "

=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Tristan Thomas." The doctor nods politely and asks me to continue, which I do: "Well, I think this is going to sound strange, but I don't know where else to turn. I've been having dreams since yesterday morning, very vivid ones... they seem real, but there's something different about them. They feel too intense somehow, almost too much to bear. It feels wrong, like I should run away or hide from something. And then I wake up, and the feeling goes away, until the next time." My voice trails off.
Dr. Szozas chuckles softly, "You say 'dreams,' but have you ever had lucid dreaming?"
That word catches me by surprise, because I never thought about it before. But now that I hear it, I realize that I probably haven't, not really. Maybe once or twice when I was younger, but nothing serious. Now, though, I wonder if what I experienced were actually dreams? If so, that means I can control them.
Dr. Szozas continues, "Lucid dreaming is a rare phenomenon, but one that I believe you may have experienced. Lucid dreamers are able to perceive their own surroundings during sleep, while still being aware that they are dreaming. To put it another way, they are awake enough to remember that they are asleep. You might call it a form of astral projection. Is that about right?"
"Yeah, I guess. That sounds about right."
He nods, and explains, "Now, most people who experience lucid dreams will just go through the motions, but some are more adventurous. Some are willing to explore what's going on with themselves -- perhaps even use it as an opportunity to confront fears that are holding them back. A good example would be a young man with depression, who learns how to fly his mind out of his body during a lucid dream, to walk around and interact with the world without

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is ... uh... Sharon." And then I pause again, unsure if this will lead anywhere good, and I add nervously, "And um..."
He looks puzzled by my hesitation, but inquires kindly, "Sharon what?"
That question makes me laugh, softly, as I recall all those times growing up where people had asked me my last name without any idea what they were doing. Well, now I have an answer, but I don't know if this doctor knows exactly what to do with me.
So I explain slowly, "Well, my parents named me after their favorite saint, Saint Sharon. But my middle name isn't 'Sainthood,' it's just plain old 'Sharon.' My whole life I've been called Sharon instead of Sainthood, but everyone calls me Sharon, too."
Dr. Szozas nods understandingly, and leans back into his chair, putting one leg up onto the corner of his desk, giving himself more height, "What else can you tell me about yourself? Tell me something personal that only you would know. Something private."
Oh, yes, I think, this is going to be fun. So I start talking about myself, telling him all kinds of things that I hadn't ever shared with anyone before. It turns out that there are many things that I haven't revealed to anyone. He asks me questions, and listens to me talk, nodding and smiling encouragingly, occasionally asking me to clarify a point or repeat an anecdote.
After half an hour or so, we are both laughing at some funny story, and he says, "You seem to be an interesting person, Sharon. I'm very interested in knowing more about you. Would you be willing to give me some information in return?"
Ah! That sounds like a fair trade, but I still feel nervous. So I ask, "Do you want to hear some stuff that I'm not sure that other people should hear

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Jessica Mayfield." I pause, waiting for something more from him, maybe a question or two? But nothing happens, and then, after another moment passes by without any further comment, I continue. "So, uh... basically, I have this weird problem where..."
He cuts me off before I can finish talking. "Let's start there," he offers, pointing to the chair across from me. We both sit down, and now we wait for each other to speak again. He doesn't rush us, nor does he hurry us along. He just sits quietly, taking his time, letting me think things through while I do the same. It's almost pleasant. Almost.
After what feels like hours, but was probably less than ten minutes, I finally begin speaking again.  I tell him about finding myself online, reading about sex and masturbation, about being aroused, about the porn sites that I've been visiting and how they feel different somehow. He listens patiently, nodding his head once or twice to show that he understands, but never offering anything substantive. His face remains neutral throughout all of this, showing neither surprise nor disgust.
Finally, when I am finished telling him everything, he stands up. He walks over to his bookshelf, and pulls out a book titled 'Manual For Treating Sexual Addiction'. He hands it to me. "Do you know what that means?" he asks, but I shake my head no. He smiles gently at me, "It means that I'm going to help you figure it out. You want to be cured of whatever it is that you're suffering from, right?"
"Yes sir!" I reply fervently, because I really need to get rid of this feeling.
"Well, first thing first: let's go over the basics. Tell me about your upbringing; about your family; about your childhood; about your life prior to coming to me; about your hobbies; about your

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Kelly."
He nods, "And why did you send an email to Dr. Michael Szozas?"
I pause again, because this is where things get weird, "Well...it seemed like something to do while waiting for the results of the test, maybe try and figure out what happened..." I trail off, unable to explain myself further.
"So you don't know anything about your condition? What does happen when you sleepwalk?" He asks.
I shake my head, "No, nothing happens when I sleep walk. My brain just decides to move without any input from me." It sounds ridiculous even as I say it, and I can tell by his reaction that he thinks so too.
He ponders for a moment, then says, "You mentioned in your message that you were having trouble sleeping. Do you have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep? Or waking up during the night?"
"Yeah, usually I go right back to bed after getting out of the shower, but sometimes I'll wake up later than usual. The next morning, I feel groggy and tired all day long. And when I lie down at night, I always end up falling asleep before I should."
He smiles broadly at me now, "Have you ever had problems with hallucinations or delusions? Any issues with anxiety or depression? Problems concentrating?"
"Nope. I've never been sick, I'm pretty healthy," I answer honestly.
"What about other unusual behavior -- have you done anything strange that would stand out to others? Have there been changes in your diet? Alcohol use? Sleeping habits?" He keeps asking questions until he finally gets an affirmative response -- "No, no unusual behaviors, no change in diet, no alcohol -- no sleeping patterns that are different -- no."
Dr. Szozas looks at me thoughtfully, and leans forward on his chair. He holds his hand palm-up, "Is there anything else that

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Kayla Jennings." My voice sounds tentative, unsure. I swallow hard, wondering what exactly this doctor will say.
He sits back in his chair, folds his hands together, then interlaces them beneath his chin. He stares at me silently for several moments, then asks softly, "Do you have any family? Parents?"
I shake my head slowly, "No...I don't think so..." The word 'think' feels strange coming out of my mouth. What do I know? Did I just wake up one day and decide that I didn't want anything to do with family anymore? Or maybe they were all dead, because I never knew who they were.
"Are there friends? People close to you that you can talk to?" He inquires kindly, but firmly.
"Um, yes, actually. There's a friend I've been talking to online, she was very helpful. We met when we both had similar problems," I answer honestly.
"What was her name?" he queries, eagerly.
"Her name was Tina -- I guess she lives in Florida now though -- I'm not sure where she went to college or what school she graduated from. She said that she had trouble sleeping, too, but with different reasons than me. And I found her through a forum that dealt with sleep disorders. I sent her an email, but haven't heard back yet -- probably she doesn't remember me," I explain, trying to be as forthcoming as possible with Dr. Szozas.
Dr. Szozas nods his understanding, "Can you tell me more about your friend?" he asks, leaning forward intently. His eyes darting about, scanning me for clues.
"Well, I know that she has trouble falling asleep, and that she wakes up frequently during the night, sometimes multiple times. Also, that she gets restless and agitated when she sleeps. Sometimes she also has nightmares, and that makes it

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Hannah."
He nods, then asks, "And why do we meet?"
"Because... because..." I stutter nervously. My mind races with thoughts, all jumbled together. Why did I decide to seek help? What can this doctor tell me that I don't already know? Am I really crazy? Is there something wrong with me?
Dr. Szozas looks at me expectantly, patiently waiting for me to say more, but I just stare back at him silently. He sighs quietly, and puts his hands up, palms facing each other, "OK, let's start again. Please state your full name for the record."
"Hannah Brown, Doctor."
"And what brings you here today?"
Now I have to answer. I should probably explain everything, right? But how much does he need to hear? It feels embarrassing talking about myself in front of someone else. Maybe I shouldn't even mention anything important, maybe I'll sound nuts if I talk too long about how I feel. Should I go straight to the point, or would it be better to give him an overview of my life first?
But before I get a chance to think any further, I blurt out, "My husband left me last month. He said he was moving away, but I found out later that he actually moved in with another woman. And now she wants custody of our daughter. She says I'm emotionally unstable, which makes sense, since I am." I pause briefly, trying to gather my composure, and continue, "She filed for divorce two weeks ago, but now they've been fighting in court. The judge sided with me initially, but the lawyer that represents her has appealed the decision, citing that my ex-husband is not fit to raise the child.
"It doesn't matter that I'm the mother, though. They want me to prove that I am stable enough to be able to care for our

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Carla, and I think there might be something wrong with me."
He nods slowly, "And what makes you believe this?"
I swallow hard, "Well...for starters..." I pause again, searching for words, "When I was younger, I would wake up screaming every night. My parents took me to doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, nothing helped. The nightmares stopped after two years, but I still had problems sleeping. At school, I couldn't concentrate very well, even though I did all right academically. It seemed like everyone else knew more than me, they were smarter, stronger, better athletes. And then there was the incident in high school where we won our state championship soccer game against a team of seniors who were ranked number one in the country. I scored three goals that day, including the winning goal in overtime. Everyone thought I was amazing, and when I went home that evening, my dad asked if I wanted to try out for the track team next year. I didn't know what sport that was, but I agreed.
"During training camp, Coach said I should run faster, jump higher, work harder, because 'it showed potential.' But none of them worked. They tried different methods, stretching, breathing techniques, meditation, hypnosis, but nothing worked. Every time I ran or jumped or sprinted, I felt exhausted afterwards. I just wasn't able to do anything well. So I quit running. After that, I started having panic attacks. Then there was another coach, who told me that I was lazy, that I needed to get motivated. He made me practice by myself for hours, but it made me sick to my stomach. So I quit that too.
"After that, I decided to go to college, but I was failing almost everything. I never studied; I'd always have an excuse not to study, or I wouldn't understand the material. So I dropped out. After that,

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Julia." My body trembles slightly as I say this, because I know what is coming next. It's not what I want to hear, though, so I brace myself mentally for his reaction.
He asks, "And why have you come today?"
Again, I hesitate, thinking about what to tell him, because honestly, I don't really understand any of this. "I guess... I think maybe something bad happened to me? Maybe something went wrong inside my head?" I ask hesitantly.
He looks surprised, "You've been experiencing auditory hallucinations?"
Oh shit, I hadn't thought about that. The words were just there, suddenly, filling my mind with images and sounds. Oh god, I can still hear them now, whispering away inside my skull. But he nods, "That does seem likely. Have they continued since then?"
It was hard to focus during our conversation, which makes sense, considering I had a hallucination right after we started talking. I couldn't concentrate very well, and so I nodded along while listening to his questions. He seemed disappointed by my answer, but not surprised.
"What sort of things do they whisper?" he asks gently.
"Sometimes... sometimes it's other people, calling out to me. Other times... voices are saying 'kill,' or 'eat.' They even said, 'suck me off.'"
Dr. Szozas sits forward, and his face is serious, "Have you ever tried to hurt anyone before?"
I shake my head no, and I look up at him, waiting to hear more about what I should or shouldn't do.
He continues to speak calmly, but with an edge to his voice that tells me that he is angry about something, "How about now? Can you feel anything when you talk to me, or are you hearing voices again?"
This time I nod yes, but I keep my voice quiet, afraid that

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Maddy Carter." I pause again, wondering where this conversation might lead. Is this guy going to help me? What does he know? How much can he tell? Should I share more than just a few details? This isn't something I want to do by myself, but there doesn't seem to be any other choice. It will only get worse if I don't do anything. Maybe I'll feel better after talking to somebody, maybe they'll have suggestions, or maybe they'll think I'm crazy... or both. Either way, I need help now.
Dr. Szozas nods, "And how old are you?" he asks next. I try to calculate what year it is.  It's been nearly two months since January 2nd, 2001. Two months ago was the day I woke up, disoriented and confused, still in bed. And now, today, July 16th, 2013, is the date on which I have an appointment with Doctor Michael Szosazs. Two months ago I wasn't sure if I'd ever wake up again. Now, however, I am starting to come back into focus. As Dr. Szozas listens intently to my answer, I realize that I really am coming back together.
"Thirty-three years old," I say softly. I'm getting tired; I must not be doing very well yet. I wish that I had taken Dr. Szozas' advice about taking a nap.
Dr. Szozas smiles, "Well then, Maddy, let us begin!"
* * *
Doctor Szozas looks at me carefully. He stares at me with those gentle hazel eyes, and he studies me as though I were his patient. Then, finally, he speaks.
"Maddy, how would you describe your current state of mind? Are you feeling depressed? Anxious? Agitated?" He pauses.
I shake my head, "

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Sally Lippman."
"How old are you?" asks Dr. Szozas, without any particular inflection. It just sounds normal to ask this question.
"Twenty-two," I answer.
He nods, then, "And where do you live? Do you have parents or guardians nearby?"
"No. My father died when I was very young, and my mother left when I was seven or eight years old."
This information elicits another nod. He is making notes on his tablet computer while we talk.
I continue, "When I was eleven, my aunt took care of me until I graduated high school last year. She raised me, basically, and she's been taking good care of me ever since."
Dr. Szozas looks up from his note-taking device, and he states, "Do you remember what life was like before your aunt came along?"
"Yes," I say, "It wasn't really much different than now. I did chores, went to school, had friends, watched TV...it all seemed fine."
"Is there anything unusual about your childhood?"
There is a pause, and I think back to that time when things were simpler. The memories are still clear, though they seem hazy somehow: sleeping alone in her bed, sitting by myself at the dining table, playing games with her dolls, or watching cartoons with her favorite DVD player. I never felt lonely or sad or depressed; that was something that didn't happen until later.
"Well, not really. I guess I always knew I would grow up, and I've done pretty well at that!"
"Are you happy with your current situation?"
I can't help but smile at his directness -- he is asking me questions that are almost impossible to refuse. And I know that Dr. Szozas is trying to get to know me better, so I tell him, "Absolutely! I
