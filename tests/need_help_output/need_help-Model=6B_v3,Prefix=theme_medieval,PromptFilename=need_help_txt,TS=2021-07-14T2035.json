  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Kaitlyn, and I don't know where to begin.\" My heart pounds in my chest, because I feel this strange sense of dread coming off of this beautiful doctor. It's almost palpable.\nHe looks back at me, and nods once, slowly. \"Well, let's start by telling me what brings you here today?\" He asks gently.\nSo I tell him about the weirdness I've been feeling lately, and then about my inability to sleep properly, and my nightmares, and the insomnia...and the changes that have occurred within me since Christmas Day. I try to describe them all carefully and precisely, trying not to miss anything, but there are times when my words fail me.\nWhen I finish, he just sits quietly, listening attentively to everything I say. When I finally stop talking, he smiles at me again, and I can't help but smile back. \"Thank you, Ms. Withers. That was very helpful,\" he responds softly.\nI stand up, and walk over to his desk, taking a few sheets of paper from his computer. He follows me with his gaze, watching me closely as I flip through the pages. There are several lines written on each page; they are names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses. I look up at Dr. Szozas, confused.\n\"I am sorry, I didn't understand you when you said 'names,' did you want me to write those down too? Names of people who might be able to assist you? Or maybe we should get started right away with a referral to a therapist?\"\nI shake my head, and I point at the list. \"No, I think I'm fine with the names. Thank you for doing that. I'm sure I'll be calling some of these folks soon.\"\nDr. Szozas is still sitting at his desk when I turn around to leave. I pause at the door, and I look",

    " the case?\"\n\"No, I guess not. I mean, I really am scared of the ocean, but I'm also excited about going to the coast to visit a friend,\" I explain."

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Katherine Lymond.\"\nHe nods, \"And why have you chosen to seek psychiatric help?\" he asks, gently probing me with questions.\nWell, this is where things get weird...\n* * *\nAs I lay there on the couch, I felt myself relax under his gentle questioning, which seemed to go along very nicely with the deep, relaxing massage he gave me. It wasn't sexual in any way, but it was intimate, and sensual, and calming, all at once. It was almost as though we were communicating telepathically, because he knew exactly what I needed without having to ask me anything. He also knows exactly what I want before I even tell him. My mind was just reeling with amazement.\n\"Katherine,\" he said, interrupting my thoughts, \"tell me more about what's been happening to you lately.\"\nSo I did, telling him about the sudden change in behavior, how I'd started feeling crazy, how I was unable to sleep or eat right. How I had begun to feel paranoid, and that I had become obsessed with sex. How I was becoming depressed about the lack of intimacy in my marriage. And then I explained how I began to read about BDSM online, and how that led me to discover the website that has caused me to be sitting here with you now.\nWhen I finished speaking, Dr. Szozas sat back, and took off his glasses, and rubbed his face with his hands. I watched his long lashes flutter against his cheeks, and his brow furrowed with thought. \"Tell me about your husband,\" he asked me, \"and how you met.\"\nThis is a little embarrassing to discuss, but I told him about the circumstances surrounding our meeting, including the fact that I didn't know about his profession when I first agreed to marry him.

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Abby Williams.\" I pause briefly before continuing, \"And I'm here because I have been having nightmares...nightmares about being raped by monsters...\" I stop there, suddenly aware that this might sound strange coming out of my mouth, but Dr. Szozas doesn't seem concerned, nor does he appear surprised. He just smiles gently at me again, waiting patiently.\nSo I continue, \"For months now, I've had recurring dreams where I'm being attacked by creatures, sometimes humanoids, sometimes not, but they always end up raping me...and then I wake up screaming. And when I do, I feel terrible guilt, shame, regret, and anger. It feels horrible, and I hate myself afterwards. I can't sleep after those dreams anymore. They keep happening, too often for comfort.\" I glance away from him, embarrassed.\nDr. Szozas sits quietly for a moment, absorbing all that I said, \"Do you know what triggers them?\" he asks.\nI shake my head, \"No, nothing obvious. Sometimes when I'm stressed out or anxious about something, but other times I don't even remember dreaming until morning.\"\nHe nods thoughtfully, and leans back in his chair, resting his arms atop the desk, \"Have you ever heard the term 'recovered memories' ? Do you understand what that means? Can you tell me more about the nature of the nightmares?\"\n\"Yes, I think I get it, but I really don't want to talk about them right now,\" I say nervously.\n\"Of course,\" he replies softly. He pauses a moment, considering his next words carefully, \"Abby, I will be completely honest with you: I don't believe that you are making up these dreams about rape. I also don't believe that the monsters are real either; I suspect that the source of the problem is psychological rather than physical. However, I am a doctor, I am trained",
