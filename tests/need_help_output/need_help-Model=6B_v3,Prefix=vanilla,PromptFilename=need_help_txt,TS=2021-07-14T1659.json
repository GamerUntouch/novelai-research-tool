Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

I hope.\nI continue, \"Well, I've been reading about you online, Dr. Szosas, and...\" My mind goes blank. What do I say next? How do I explain myself? Do I even need to? This is all new territory for me.\nDr. Szozas cuts off any further explanation by saying, \"Let's start with you telling me what brought you here today.\"\n\"Um... Well, I had an email address that was sent to me by one of those websites where people post their problems, and they were asking if anyone knew anything about unusual cases, or wanted advice. And I thought that I might be able to find out more about myself through talking to you, Dr. Szozas.\"\nHe smiles kindly at me, and asks, \"And did you?\"\nI nod, and try to smile back at him, but my face doesn't want to cooperate.\n\"So, let's get started with some background information. I'd like to ask you several questions, but first I'd like to hear about you. Why don't we begin with your childhood, and how old are you now?\"\n\"Oh... Um, I'm thirty-four years old.\"\n\"That's quite young. You must have grown up with a lot of excitement.\" He pauses to think for a moment, and I wonder what else I should be sharing. There is so much I haven't told him! So many things that I shouldn't be thinking about! But that would be rude to keep quiet! So I share with Dr. Szozas everything that happened in my life",

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

Do you have any other names? Anything else?\"\nOh crap... what do I say? What should I tell this doctor? The truth? No, he'll find out soon enough anyway. Maybe I can lie? Or maybe I shouldn't even try to hide anything. Maybe I should just tell him everything. But then I'd feel guilty afterwards, wouldn't I? If only there was somebody who would know what was going on with me, or if I had anybody to talk to. There's nobody left that knows me anymore, except for one person: Auntie Jane. She's been gone for years, and she won't return my calls anyway.\nBut I don't want to bring her up, because then I might lose all hope. And I need help right away, before things spiral out of control. So I decide to answer honestly.\n\"No, I've never used another name; that's the only one I go by. It's the same name my parents gave me when they adopted me at birth.\"\nDr. Szozas listens intently, his smile deepening into a genuine grin. He leans forward, his face inches from mine, \"Tell me about your family, Katherine Rose. Where did you grow up? Who were your friends back home?\"\nSo I begin, telling him about my childhood. About how I grew up with my auntie, and about how everybody loved me. He asks me more questions about growing up, about school, about my job. I give him details about my life, and his warm, caring demeanor doesn't change. He's still smiling at me, his eyes twinkling with curiosity.\nFinally, I",
