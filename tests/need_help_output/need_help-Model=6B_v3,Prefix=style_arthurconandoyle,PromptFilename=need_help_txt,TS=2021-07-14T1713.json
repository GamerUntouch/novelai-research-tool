Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

It all started last week after I looked through the spider’s web.\"\r\nDr. Szozas raises an eyebrow, \"Yes? And what did you find there?\"\r\n\"A lot of stuff,\" I say softly, \"and then this morning I woke up feeling really weird, and I went back to look at the web again, and I found something else. The web wasn't just talking about me. It was talking about other people too, and I got scared because I didn't know what to do.\"\r\nDr. Szozas looks concerned, \"Why don't we start by taking a moment to review what happened when you were viewing the web page.\"\r\nSo I tell him about waking up that morning, seeing the web page, and how I was suddenly aware that everyone had been watching me, and they knew more than I wanted them to know about me. I describe the way that the web seemed to have a personality of its own, and how the pages kept changing even though nothing changed about me. I tell him about the spider's message, which I think I remember correctly, saying that I would be a great success if I only believed that I deserved it. I tell him about the way that I felt that I was being watched constantly, and that I couldn't get away from the idea that I was somehow under surveillance. I tell him about the way that I felt that I was hiding things about myself that I shouldn't be, and that I needed to change if I ever wanted to be happy. I talk about the fear that I've been having about the future, the fear that I might be letting the wrong person into my life, the fear that I'm not good enough. I mention that I feel that I need help,",

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

How did you find me?\"\r\nAgain I stop, because I don't want to lie to him, even though I have already done that once today, \"You answered my email,\" I admit.\r\n\"Ahh, yes, right, ok, go ahead,\" he responds, and he sits back in his chair, listening attentively while I tell him all about what happened since Friday night: The car accident, the hospital visit, the web search, and now the doctor's appointment.\r\nAs I talk, he listens intently, nodding along occasionally, asking questions if I get stuck or if there is something unclear. When I finish talking, he leans forward in his chair, hands clasped together between his knees, elbows resting on them. His face is serious, his gaze intense. \"So...you think you might be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder?\"\r\nI nod slowly. \"Yes, I'm pretty sure that's what I am experiencing.\"\r\nDr. Szozas grins widely, showing me his pearly whites, \"Well, let me ask you a few more questions, just to be sure, but I'm going to give you a prescription to help calm you down, alright?\"\r\nI smile at him, relieved that I'm not being sent away with a diagnosis that I don't need. I've been through enough emotional trauma for one day. I'm happy to leave that part behind me, at least for a little while. I'm also curious about the drug he has prescribed, so I reply, \"OK, sure, I'll try anything at this point. What is",
