   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Melanie.\"\nHe nods.\nI continue, \"And I've been having nightmares... bad ones...\"\n\"Mmm hmmm,\" he replies.\nI pause again, trying to decide where to go next. My mouth opens and closes several times before I finally blurt out, \"They say that dreams can foretell things that will happen soon after they occur...\"\nSzozas sits forward slightly, leaning in toward me, his face very close to mine now, \"Do you dream?\"\nI nod.\n\"Tell me more about them,\" he prompts, and I do, telling him about the one in which I was being chased by monsters in black robes. The fear that I felt when I awoke.\n\"So what does this tell us?\" asks Dr. Szozas.\n\"That I'm scared shitless,\" I answer honestly.\n\"But why? What did you think would have happened if you didn't wake up?\"\nI sigh deeply, \"It was just a nightmare, but I don't know. It makes sense though; I haven't had any contact with the outside world since I woke up. And when I went back to sleep last night, I had another bad dream about the same thing. I'm afraid that something horrible is going to happen to me.\"\nDr. Szozas leans back in his chair, his arms folded across his chest, his expression serious. I wait patiently while he thinks about what to ask next. I begin to fidget a little bit, because I am anxious about his reaction.\nFinally, he looks at me, his eyes searching, and I feel a pang of anxiety; I hope that I'm doing OK. He speaks, his voice low, calm, reassuring, \"Melanie, I want to assure you that whatever is happening to you is not your fault. You are a wonderful person with a bright future ahead of you. I'm going to help you",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Dawn.\"\nHe nods, then asks, \"And where do you live?\"\n\"In Boston.\"\n\"Do you have any family there? Friends?\"\n\"No, none.\"\n\"Are you married?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"To whom?\"\n\"Eric.\"\n\"What does Eric do?\"\n\"We work together at the same company.\"\n\"How long have you been living in Boston?\"\n\"About six years now.\"\n\"Have you ever had a mental health problem before?\"\n\"Well...\" I begin, thinking back... No, nothing serious. Just a few bouts of depression during college, and one other incident when I was younger. But that wasn't really a 'mental illness', just an episode of severe anxiety. I've never taken medication or anything.\nDr. Szozas looks up at me, his smile fading away, \"Dawn, can you tell me what happened last night? When you were watching TV, alone in bed?\"\nOh God. I didn't want to say this out loud. The thought of telling someone about that made me feel sick to my stomach. I felt a wave of nausea wash through my body, and the room began spinning. \"It was awful,\" I whispered. \"I couldn't stop shaking. I was sweating all over, I was afraid that I was going to die. I tried to get up to go to the bathroom, but I was too scared to move.\"\n\"Did you try to call anyone for help?\"\n\"Of course I did! I called 911, but they said I was fine, that I was probably having a nightmare, that I was hallucinating. I was crying hysterically when I hung up the phone, and I was still trembling when I fell asleep. I woke up early, but I was terrified that I would be dead when morning came.

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Alyssa Harper.\" My heart races faster than normal as I speak those words. What have I done? Why did I do this? Is there any way back now?\nHe nods thoughtfully, and then asks, \"Why don't we start by talking about what brought you here today?\"\nSo I tell him about being attacked online by something...or rather, someone. The more I talk, the more I realize just how much I've been affected by all of this. I feel guilty and ashamed, which only makes me want to confess further, to unburden myself.\nAs I speak, he listens intently, nodding along. When I finish speaking, he sits silently for a moment before asking me a question: \"Do you think that maybe you had an episode?\"\nI nod hesitantly, \"Yes. It feels like one. Like I was possessed or something. And I was angry about something.\"\nDr. Szozas smiles knowingly, \"Well, let's get started...\"\nWe begin our session with a thorough examination of my mental health history, including past episodes, medications taken, childhood trauma, etc., and the results are clear; I am completely healthy. I am also relieved to hear that I am not suffering from anything physically wrong with my body. I'm not sure if I should be happy about that, but I am at least able to put that worry aside.\nAfter a few minutes of discussion about the attacks, the nature of the internet, and my feelings about the experience, I ask about the attack itself; the doctor tells me that I'm not alone in having experienced such a thing.\n\"You say that you were 'attacked,' but I'm not sure that that is the right word. You are describing a situation where you became the victim of a digital assault.\" He explains that while I may have felt that I was the target of the attack, the reality is that I was the source.",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Kaitlyn Bannister.\" I pause, then continue, \"It's just easier if we use first names, don't you think?\" I ask.\nHe nods, \"That makes sense, yes...Kaitlyn, please tell me what brought you here today? How do you feel about being referred by a friend?\"\nSo I start talking: \"Well, it all started with this website called 'the web', which I came across while browsing through the Internet. It seemed very interesting, so I clicked on it, and I found myself reading more and more until I realized that I had been spending hours a day there, looking at things I shouldn't have looked at. I can't remember exactly how long ago this happened, but I know that I spent several days doing nothing else but reading the stories posted on that site. That was when I noticed that I felt different, somehow. I've always loved to read, but now it feels like I'm obsessed with it, or something...\"\n\"Did anything happen before that point in time? Any changes in behavior? Did you experience any strange feelings, thoughts, sensations?\"\nI shake my head, \"No. I didn't even realize that I was feeling weird about reading too much until I started to read those stories about people who were having similar problems with their obsessions. They talked about the same things that I'd been thinking about, about wanting to read books that I wasn't supposed to read, about not being able to stop. And I got scared about that, because I thought that if I really did read the wrong books, that I might end up becoming one of them. I went home, but I couldn't sleep, so I kept going back to the computer, trying to find out more about that thing that was happening to me.\"\nDr. Szozas sits quietly for a moment, listening to me talk. He smiles, and looks up at me, his gaze seeming",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Jane Doe.\" My voice quivers slightly as I speak. It feels strange to give this information to another person. What if they can't help me? What if I'm just crazy after all? No one will believe me...\nHe smiles, \"Jane Doe?\" he asks, and I nod, \"Well, let's get started then.\" And he begins asking questions: \"What do you think is happening to you?\" \"How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?\" \"Have there ever been any prior episodes?\" \"Do you feel safe at home?\" \"Are you being bullied by anyone or anything?\" \"Do you know what triggered your current episode?\" \"Does anyone else seem to be affected?\" \"Is there anything you've done recently that might be related?\"\nAnd on and on. The answers that I provide are all truthful, yet somehow the doctor seems to sense something different about them. As if he already knows more than I do, and perhaps even things that I don't suspect myself knowing. But I'm not sure how much of this I should tell him; I need his help, but I don't want to be a burden to him.\nWhen we finish our conversation, he stands up, \"Thank you very much for coming today,\" he tells me. \"We'll talk again soon. In the meantime, please try to relax; I know that this is hard for you to accept, but it's important that you stay calm until I can arrange a follow-up appointment with me.\"\nWith that said, he leaves me alone in his office. I am left to ponder the strangeness of the situation, to wonder at the nature of the man that I met, and the oddness of the session that I had with him.\nBut I mustn't dwell too much; I must be strong, and I must push through this. I must find the strength to overcome whatever is driving me to madness; I must be the master",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Jane Doe.\"\nHe nods, and then asks, \"Jane...Doe?\"\n\"Yes...\"\n\"And why did you choose that name?\"\nThis question makes me pause, because I don't know where this line of questioning will lead, but I answer, \"Well, I think 'Janey Duh' would have been too obvious, right? And I thought maybe that the 'Jane' part might suggest something else, other than just being plain old Jane.\"\nDr. Szozas chuckles, \"So, Jane Doe: What can we do for you today?\"\n\"Um...well, I've had a couple dreams recently that were really vivid and disturbing, and I'd appreciate any insight or advice you can give me.\"\nDr. Szozas sits back in his chair, and looks at me intently, \"You said two dreams, what was the second one about?\"\nOh God, I'm not ready to talk about that yet, \"It wasn't very pleasant, actually; I woke up feeling sick afterwards.\"\n\"OK, tell me about the first dream.\"\n\"Well, there I was standing on top of a building, overlooking downtown Boston, and I saw a bunch of people getting killed by a huge snake monster that came out of the water. It started swallowing people whole, and I watched them get torn apart from the inside out. I ran away screaming, but I couldn't run fast enough to escape the thing. I got lost in the streets, and I found myself running through an alleyway that ended with a dead end, with a big pile of bodies blocking the way out. I felt the snake monster coming after me, and I knew that I was going to die if I didn't find another exit. I tried to climb the body pile, but I slipped off, and fell into the sewer below, and I drowned in the dark murky waters.\"\nI stop talking, but I am",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Elizabeth Reiss.\"\nHe nods slowly, waiting patiently, then asks, \"And why have you chosen to visit our offices?\"\n\"Well... because...\" I pause, unsure what exactly to say next, \"because I've had this feeling lately that something is wrong with me. Like there's something missing, or broken inside of me. And I think maybe if I talk to somebody about it, they can help me figure out what it is. Or at least point me in the right direction.\"\n\"Interesting. How long have you been having such feelings?\" he inquires gently.\n\"Ever since I started reading those web pages. The ones about people being different, not normal. It scared me, and I felt weird after reading them. But I kept thinking about them, and I couldn't stop myself. I just wanted more information, and I thought if I got enough information, I might find out what was happening to me. That would explain why I feel so strange, and off-kilter. If I knew what was causing it, I could deal with it somehow.\"\nDr. Szozas nods again, \"Yes, yes, very good answer.\" He smiles at me kindly, his eyes still boring into mine, \"Now tell me about the specific symptoms that you are experiencing?\"\n\"Umm, well, I don't know where to start. I get these crazy mood swings, sometimes I'm happy, other times I'm sad, or angry or anxious or depressed or whatever. I also seem to be losing control of certain things, like I used to be able to do pretty much anything I set my mind to, but now I'm starting to lose that ability. I'm finding that I'm getting distracted by little things that I never noticed before. I'm seeing patterns and meanings everywhere, even though I'm not consciously aware of any of the details that I'm perceiving. I don't really understand how to describe",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Mary Jane Watson.\"\nHe nods, \"And where do you live?\"\n\"New York City,\" I reply.\n\"Do you have any other names? Names by which you might be known? For example, is there another person named 'Mary Jane Watson', or perhaps a character named 'MJ'? Or maybe something else entirely different?\"\n\"No...just MJ.\"\n\"Well then, let us begin, shall we?\"\nWe start off with some small talk. We discuss our respective jobs, hobbies, family, etc., and I realize that this is actually quite easy. It feels good being able to converse with someone, even if they are a doctor. I feel myself relax, and soon I am smiling again.\nAfter a while, I ask, \"So what exactly does a psychiatrist do? Is it just talking to people?\"\n\"Yes, although most of the time, we'll also conduct an examination. Sometimes, however, I will simply listen to a patient's concerns or problems, and offer advice based on my experience. If you'd like to know more about the practice of psychiatry, please visit Wikipedia.org.\"\nDr. Szozas stands up, and heads back to his chair. \"OK, I think that covers the basics, now, I'm going to give you a few tests to evaluate certain aspects of your mental health. Please don't worry about them; I promise that all information gathered is confidential. Are you ready?\"\nI nod nervously.\n\"All right, I want you to close your eyes, and focus inward, relaxing your mind. Take a deep breath, and exhale slowly. Now, imagine a white light within, shining brightly, filling the room with its warmth. Imagine the light is moving inside you, flowing through you, warming you from the inside out. Feel the heat radiating outwards...\"\nA smile spreads across his face, \"That was nice! I'm glad that",
