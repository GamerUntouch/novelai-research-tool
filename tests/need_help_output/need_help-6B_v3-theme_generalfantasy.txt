=== Prompt ========================================
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "

=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Tamsin Wilson." I pause for a moment, wondering if I should continue. It feels strange talking to this stranger, but somehow I feel more confident than before. "Um... I don't really know what else to say. I just..." I stop again, feeling myself blush. My mind goes blank, but then suddenly something occurs to me: "Wait, did you ask me all those questions?"
He nods slowly, "Yes, we have a lot to cover, and I need to get started right away. Do you want anything to drink? Water or tea would be fine," he asks.
A glass of water sounds good, I answer, "Sure, thanks."
Dr. Szozas stands up, and heads to the kitchen, where he pours us each a glass of ice cold water. He returns to his chair, and hands me the glass, "Here, try some." I sip the cool liquid, which tastes wonderful, and I thank him.
We sit quietly for a while, sipping our drinks, until Dr. Szozas speaks up, "So, tell me about yourself. Where do you live? What are your interests outside of schoolwork? Family history? Any medical conditions that might be relevant? Anything at all that may be interesting about you, or that you think I should be aware of?"
Wow! This guy is amazing. I've never met anyone who asked me such personal things before, and I'm surprised by the depth of his interest. I start to talk about my life, starting with high school and working my way through college, with a few stops along the way. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be telling him about my family, but I mention them anyway. I also explain that I'm a virgin (well, almost) and that I'm a little nervous about getting involved with a man.
Dr. Szozas listens attentively to everything I say,

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Elizabeth."
He smiles again, this time more broadly, "So tell me about yourself, Liz. Why did you want to meet with me?"
What do I say? What can I possibly say? My mind races, and then I realize what I should have said before: "My name is Lizzy, not Liz. But please call me Lizzie." I feel myself blush slightly, and then continue, "Well, I guess I'm just confused right now...I don't know if I'm crazy or not..." I pause, trying to find the words to describe what I've been feeling. Finally I decide, "It's like there's something inside of me that wants to hurt people, but I'm scared because I'm afraid if I let it out, I'll go insane or die." I stop talking, embarrassed by my own lack of eloquence.
Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding occasionally, and smiling gently. He looks concerned, but also thoughtful. I wait patiently while he thinks things through. "You were saying that you wanted to harm others. Is that accurate?"
I nod, not trusting my voice yet.
"Why would you think that way?"
I shrug helplessly, "Because I always have. I remember being a little girl, playing with dolls, and I used to pretend that they were real, and I'd kill them. And I didn't even understand that I was doing anything wrong until much later, when I was older. I still haven't really figured out why I was thinking that way, but I keep having the same thoughts, and I'm scared that I'm going to start hurting people."
"Do you recall any specific incidents where you felt that desire to inflict pain on another person?"
I shake my head slowly. I'm so ashamed that I almost cry, but I fight the tears back. I look at Dr. Szazas, and I try to

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Aimee."
He nods, and continues, "And why did you decide to seek help?"
"Well..." I begin, "It started off as just this little nagging feeling that something wasn't quite right with me. And then I got more concerned after reading through all the information on your website, because...well, I've been having dreams lately. Dreams where I can remember things, but they aren't real memories. They seem to be fragments of memory, maybe even bits of other people's lives. It's frustrating, because there are parts that I don't understand."
Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair, and ponders my words carefully, nodding occasionally, "Hmmmmm..." He pauses for a moment, considering what I have said, "OK, let's start by talking about those 'fragments,' if you will. Can you tell me about them? What do they feel like when you wake up from them?"
I try to recall the details of the dream I had last night, which was pretty strange: I was standing next to a road, and it seemed that cars were coming closer and closer to me. The sky looked cloudy, and the air smelled cold. I felt very confused, and I didn't know why I was doing anything that I was doing. I think I may have been trying to cross the street or walk across the field or something. But I couldn't figure out why I would be doing that. I tried to ask myself questions, but I couldn't get any answers. I was alone, and I kept walking away, but I couldn't stop.
Then I woke up.
"That sounds interesting. How about now, are you still experiencing these feelings?"
I shake my head no, "No, I'm fine."
"Are you sure? You sound a bit nervous."
"Yeah, I am a bit nervous. I'm not really used to being

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Mary Beth Jorgenson."
He nods, and then asks, "And what brings you here?"
Oh, boy, now we get to it. I have been dreading this moment all week, wondering if I would ever even find the courage to tell anyone about the things that happened to me during the last two weeks. I steel myself, and begin, "Well, um... It started one night after work..."
A few hours later, I feel drained, exhausted, relieved, and happy. As I leave his office, I know that I can trust him completely. The fact that he doesn't ask any questions, just accepts what I say without question, tells me that I don't need to explain anything further.
Later that evening, I email Dr. Szozas to thank him for taking time out of his busy schedule to meet with me. I also send him a copy of the video of me being raped by my boss. He responds right away:
Dear Miss Jorgenson,
Thank you very much for coming to see me today. I enjoyed meeting with you, and I hope that our conversation was helpful to you.
As I mentioned in our phone call earlier today, I do specialize in unusual cases, such as yours. In fact, I'm somewhat surprised that you were able to identify me from the website photos, which are not particularly flattering or revealing.
You asked me to state the facts for the record, and I will do so briefly.
First, I should point out that there are many forms of rape, each with their own particular characteristics. I am not trying to suggest that your case is unique or unusual; rather, I am simply pointing out that the situation you describe is within the range of possibilities that I deal with regularly.
Second, I must caution you that the details of a sexual assault are often upsetting and difficult to discuss. However, I strongly recommend that you try to be honest with me

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is ...  . I've been having trouble sleeping lately, and I can't seem to get rid of this feeling of dread. It's driving me nuts." My words sound stilted and odd coming from my mouth, even though they were rehearsed before entering his office. I try again, "It's hard to describe, but I feel... I don't know what I feel, but it makes me uneasy. Like something bad is going to happen soon, or maybe already happened. And there is nothing I can do to change anything that happens next. That's all I want help figuring out. Is that enough?"
He nods slowly, and then looks back at me, "You have good instincts, Ms. ..."
"Szabo," I offer, "Karen Szabo."
"Ms. Szabo, let me ask you a few questions. Are you experiencing any unusual thoughts or feelings? Do you think about death much? Nightmares? Anything like that?" He asks me, while scribbling notes on a yellow pad of paper.
"No, not really," I answer honestly, "Well, yes, actually. The dreams are getting worse. They used to be just nightmares about being killed, but now I'm dreaming about other things too. I'm seeing visions of people dying. I'm seeing them die horribly. Sometimes I'm the one killing the person. I'm the killer!"
Dr. Szozas looks up at me, his expression is grave, but I sense that his concern is genuine, "That sounds very frightening, but I'm sure that you'll be fine. What about the rest of the dream? Can you tell me about it?"
"Oh, I'm the murderer. I'm the one who is doing the killings. I'm the one who is causing the deaths. I'm the one that is hurting the victims. But it is always me that is the victim too. I am the killer,

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Jessica."
He nods slowly, as though taking careful note of each word I say, "And?"
"Well...my husband left me three weeks ago, after we had been married almost four years..."
There, I said it, even if I didn't quite know what happened. But now I do. And there will be more questions later.
Dr. Szozas looks concerned, and reaches out to place his hand gently atop mine, "That sounds very stressful, dear, and I can imagine how difficult this would be."
I nod, "It's not easy being alone."
He smiles again, "What brought this on? Did something happen between you two?"
"No, nothing really happened. We just stopped having sex. It was fine before then, and I thought things were still good, but they weren't. My hormones got all messed up, and I started feeling weird. I wanted to get away from home, and I decided to go on a trip to visit my family up north. When I came back, I tried to work things out with Mark, but when I went back, he wasn't there anymore."
Dr. Szozas interjects, "You seem to be a very attractive young woman, I understand that you have a child together, a daughter, is that correct?"
"Yes, she is seven. She lives with her father now, I don't think I'll ever be able to forgive myself if I lose my little girl too, I need help."
"How old are you, Jessica?"
"Twenty-two."
"So, you've only been married a few months, but already you feel that you want to leave him behind?"
"Yeah, I guess I did at first, but I realized that I couldn't stay with him any longer. He doesn't care about me, he just wants to use me. I was happy once, but I'm

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Sookie Stackhouse." And then I pause again before adding, "Ahem...and because this is all new to me, and I don't know where else to turn..." I trail off, hoping that he'll fill in the blank.
He nods thoughtfully, "That sounds very logical." His smile turns more genuine, and his gaze shifts away from mine. It occurs to me that he might have been staring at me, which makes me feel self-conscious. My face gets hot, and I start fiddling with the hem of my shirt. The silence stretches out uncomfortably long, until finally I say, "So what do we talk about?"
"Well," he begins slowly, "you've clearly had a lot of stress lately, haven't you? You seem to be under a great deal of pressure. Do you think that's normal?"
Oh boy, I'd rather not go there right now. "Yes," I admit reluctantly, feeling myself flush even hotter than before.
Dr. Szozas looks surprised. His eyebrows raise just slightly. I wonder if he's ever heard anyone tell the truth about being stressed out. I want to add something like 'yes,' but I can't bring myself to lie to a doctor. I sigh.
"Do you mind telling me about that?"
There are times when I really hate lying to people, especially to doctors. But I guess I owe them the truth. I try to explain about the vampire Bill Compton. I leave out the part about the werewolves, since I'm sure they aren't interested in that. I'm pretty certain Dr. Szozas isn't either.
After I finish the story, I wait for his reaction. I'm afraid that I'm going to get a lecture. I'm expecting a little one.
Instead, Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair with a thoughtful expression. He rubs his chin with his index finger

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Elizabeth Parker." I pause, then add, "and I think something is wrong with me. Something is really bothering me inside. It feels like there's this huge weight pressing down on me all day long, and I just can't seem to shake it off. And when I do try to sleep, I have nightmares." My head drops forward, and I stare at the floor. This is hard stuff to admit to anyone else. But somehow I know Dr. Szozas will understand, and help me.
He sits quietly for a moment, and then asks, "Elizabeth, did you ever receive any psychological counseling before?"
I nod, "Yes, I've been seeing a therapist since college."
"And what was her diagnosis?"
"Well, she thought maybe I had depression, anxiety, or stress related problems. She prescribed medication, which I didn't want to take because I knew I would become dependent on them. So I stopped going after awhile."
"Do you still feel depressed? Do you suffer from anxiety?"
"No, not anymore. The doctor said I was fine now."
Dr. Szozas nods slowly, "So tell me more about your dreams."
I describe the recurring nightmare where I am a child again, running through a dark forest, searching desperately for my parents. He listens intently, asking questions to clarify things, but I don't mind; I'm eager to talk about it. I explain that I wake up feeling terrified and confused, and I'm unable to recall anything about the dream until I am awake.
The psychiatrist continues to ask me questions about the details, such as whether I remember being frightened, and if I remember the location of the woods. I answer yes to both, and I realize that I am becoming aroused by the conversation. I blush slightly at the realization that I am getting turned on listening to Dr. Szozas discuss the contents of my dreams. I am embarrassed

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Tamsin Winters, and I've been having...issues."
He nods, slowly, and looks back up at me, "And what sort of issues do you have?"
This question catches me off guard. I can't believe I just said this out loud. What would he think if I told him? Would he judge me, or laugh at me? My mind races trying to figure out how to answer him without sounding crazy.
Oh god, what should I say?!
So finally, I blurt out, "Well, um..."
Dr. Szozas smiles, reassuringly, "Just tell me whatever is true, even if it doesn't sound reasonable or sane. Don't hold anything back."
What else could I possibly say? How much worse could things get than they already are?
Then I hear myself saying, "It started when I was about fifteen years old, when I saw a ghost. It was one night while I was sleeping, and I woke up screaming. The next morning, I couldn't remember any details about the dream. But then all sorts of weird stuff happened after that; I heard voices, smelled perfume, felt sensations of touch, and sometimes I had feelings of being watched by somebody. I don't know what's going on with me, but I really need help."
Dr. Szozas listens quietly, his face solemn, "That's quite a story, Ms. Winters. Tell me more about the ghosts that you've seen, and the other strange occurrences that seem to be happening with you. Please, go ahead."
So I start talking, and I'm surprised at how easy it is to talk to Dr. Szozas about these things. I feel a little silly telling him about the invisible people who were watching me, but maybe I shouldn't be embarrassed about that.
After a few minutes, I'm done with the whole story, "Do you think I

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is...Lily." My voice sounds very small, and timid, as though I've been waiting all day to say this simple sentence.
He nods slowly, then asks, "And Lily, tell me about what brings you to our office today?"
I feel myself begin to relax, as I realize that I have nothing to hide from him. I answer, "Well..." I pause again, before continuing, "...I think something is wrong with me."
Dr. Szozas smiles gently, "That's quite alright. Tell me more about that." He leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees, hands clasped together between them. The gesture is casual, relaxed, friendly. It makes me want to lean back against his chest and close my eyes, just to listen to the sound of his voice.
So I continue, "It started two weeks ago, when I noticed that I was having trouble sleeping. I tried to go to sleep, but couldn't get there. Even when I did manage to nod off, I had strange dreams. Dreams about monsters, and things that were trying to kill me, or eat me alive. I didn't know if they were real, but sometimes I woke up screaming. And I kept waking up during the night, because I thought that I heard noises coming from outside the house. I went to the window, but I saw no one, no cars, no trucks, no people walking along the road. I'm sure that I would have seen someone out there, but I never did. I looked through the windows of the other houses that are near ours, but I never saw anyone either.
The next morning I felt fine, but I still wasn't able to fall asleep at bedtime. I got up early, and took a walk. I walked until I reached the river, which is about three miles away. I sat by the bank, watching the water flow past me, thinking about how I can
