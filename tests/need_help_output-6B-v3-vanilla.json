   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Alyssa.\"\nHe nods, waiting patiently.\n\"Um... My family moved away when I was six years old. We were living near Boston, Massachusetts. When we left there, they said that we would never return. That our home had been destroyed by fire, and that everyone died. It was all lies though...\"\nA pause while he listens intently.\n\"...So now I'm trying to find out what really happened to them, because I want to know if I'll ever go back to where I grew up again. If anyone knows anything, please tell me.\"\nAnother long silence, and then he smiles gently, \"Tell me more about this 'home'.\"\nI start talking, slowly at first, describing my childhood memories of the place, and the people who lived there. The house was big and rambling, with four bedrooms upstairs, two bathrooms, one downstairs. There was an attic room, which I think may have served as a playroom or guest bedroom. And there were lots of trees: maple, oak, elm, birch, hickory, redwood, etc., plus wild grasses growing everywhere; I remember being very fond of walking through the woods barefoot.\nThere was also a pond behind the property, and a small stream that ran along the side of the yard. I don't recall any neighbors, but that doesn't necessarily mean that no other homes existed nearby.\nDr. Szozas' face scrunches up slightly, and his eyebrows rise up, and his lips part, and his voice comes out quiet, barely audible, \"This sounds just like the home that I used to live in.\"\nThe shock registers, and I stammer, \"What? You did?\"\n\"Yes. Yes, I did. I lived at that address, too. Do you remember me at all?\"\nThe shock becomes even greater, and I reply, \"No! No,",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Sarah.\" I pause briefly, then add, \"I've been having problems with my boyfriend.\" My heart races slightly. The doctor looks back up at me, and his face shows nothing other than interest and curiosity. He nods encouragingly.\n\"Tell me more about this problem you have, please.\"\nSo I do. I tell him about my difficulties with my boyfriend. How we've had our ups and downs, and now things seem to be getting worse. I describe my fears and anxieties, and explain how they drive me crazy. I talk about my dreams, which involve being chased by something evil. And then there's the feeling that I'm losing control, that I'm going insane. That scares me even more.\nDr. Szozas listens intently. He asks questions. Sometimes I answer, sometimes I don't know what to say. I feel myself starting to panic. It all sounds too much like a bad dream or a nightmare. I want it to stop. But I can't find any words to express the feelings inside me.\nAt last, I hear Dr. Szozas sigh deeply. His expression changes; his eyebrows arch upward, and his mouth forms an O shape. He leans forward, and puts one hand gently on top of mine, while the other rests lightly on my knee.\nHe speaks slowly, almost thoughtfully, \"Sarah... I think that maybe you should consider seeing me again.\" He pauses, and adds, \"If you need help, that is.\"\nI smile at him gratefully.\nWe meet again two weeks later, and I bring with me a letter from my boyfriend. We go through the same routine: he describes his relationship with me, I tell him about my nightmares, about the fact that I am afraid to leave home alone. Dr. Szozas notes everything, nodding, smiling, and writing it all down.\nIt was so reassuring to be able to talk about these",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Rachel.\" My heart beats faster, because I feel strange. It feels good, but also uncomfortable. I feel a little dizzy, and a tingling sensation spreads across my body, which makes me shiver. This is different than what I felt before, when I went to the doctor and got the pills. I didn't know whether or not they were working then. But this...this feels right somehow. Like something inside me knows exactly where it needs to go.\nDr. Szozas looks at me, and asks softly, \"And why did you seek help?\" He leans forward, resting his elbows onto his knees. He's waiting patiently, and I can tell that there isn't going to be any rush to get things done. He wants to understand what brought me here. What is happening?\nI pause again, and try to gather myself. I'm not sure if I should say anything or not, but after thinking about it for several minutes, I decide to speak up. \"Well, uhm...\" I start slowly, \"It all started when I had sex with another woman. And she wanted more than just intercourse, she said that we would do other stuff together. She kept asking me about anal play, and oral sex. At first, I was hesitant; but she insisted that I give her head, and let her put her mouth on me. I think that maybe she saw me as an easy lay. After that, she took control. We went to a hotel room, but instead of fucking, she used me. That's when I first realized that I wasn't really attracted to men anymore. I don't want to talk too much about it, but...it turned me off, but I still loved her.\nBut I couldn't stop. The thought of being with a woman made me excited, and I needed to have her. So, I cheated on her. I told her that I wouldn't be able to",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Heather Wilson.\" My heart races at this point. What do I tell him? How can I explain what happened? The words just won't form properly.\nHe nods slowly, then asks, \"Why did you contact me?\"\nThis question makes me feel more relaxed, less anxious, maybe even embarrassed. It feels good to share something personal with another person. It also helps me relax. Maybe we'll get along after all...\nSo I begin to talk: \"Well, I've been having trouble sleeping lately. I have trouble falling asleep, and staying asleep. Sometimes I wake up during the night, and sometimes I stay awake until dawn. I don't know if there's anything wrong with me, but I want to find out what's going on. Is that strange enough for you?\"\nDr. Szozas smiles again, \"Not at all, not at all. Please continue.\"\nI start talking, describing my symptoms. I'm finding it easier to speak now, because it's helping me calm myself down. As I go on, I realize that I am enjoying telling Dr. Szozas about myself. He listens attentively, nodding occasionally, asking questions when necessary. When I finish, he sits back in his chair, and lets out an audible sigh, \"OK, let me ask you a few questions. First, are you sexually active?\"\nNow that he mentions sex, I blush furiously. Why would he think that I was interested in sex? I am certainly not! But I nod anyway.\n\"How many sexual partners have you had?\"\n\"None. Never.\"\n\"Have you ever masturbated to orgasm?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Do you remember any dreams or nightmares that you may have had recently?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"What were they about?\"\n\"Um, well, one was really bad.

His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books.

State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

Someone who understands.\nSo I start by saying, \"A few months ago, I started having dreams where things were coming alive inside of me.\"\nDr. Szozas looks surprised, but not overly concerned, \"What sort of things?\"\n\"Things living inside of me. Things growing and changing within me. It felt very real. Like something was actually moving around inside of me. My chest would ache sometimes when I woke up, because I had been dreaming such intense stuff. A lot of times, it seemed like I couldn't catch my breath until after I'd woken up.\"\nDr. Szozas smiles, \"Are those feelings still present now?\"\n\"Yes sir. They are. Sometimes, I'll wake up feeling like there's something crawling all over me, or that I need to breathe deeply, but I never feel completely normal anymore. When I get really scared, I can't stop shaking, even though it feels good at first. Something is trying to break free, but I don't know if it wants to be free, or just needs to be let out. I don't know which way to go. Or what to do. I've tried to reach out to people about it, but nobody believes me. Nobody ever listens to me. I'm afraid to try to leave home, because I think I might be crazy if I run away from them, but I also don't want to stay here either. I hate being alone.\n\"When I went to school, I thought that everyone else must be experiencing these same feelings.",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Janice Covington.\" I pause, then continue, \"I think something happened to me while I was working late last night... I don't know what. I woke up this morning feeling strange, different. It wasn't until after I went online to check out what had been happening, that I realized what had changed. I have never felt anything like this before. And now...\" I trail off, and wait.\nHe looks back at me, waiting for more information. I feel myself blushing slightly, embarrassed by my lack of clarity. The doctor just smiles kindly, encouragingly. My mind races, trying to figure out what exactly did happen to me? What can I say? How do I explain all this?\nFinally, I manage to gather enough courage to speak again, \"It feels like I've become an entirely new person overnight.\"\nDr. Szozas nods slowly, as if he understands. He leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees, and places his hands together, clasping them tightly between his legs, \"Tell me about it.\"\nSo I tell him, starting with my run-in with Mr. Dickson yesterday afternoon. As I'm telling him, I realize that I am talking too much, that I need to slow down, but I cannot seem to stop. When I finally finish, Dr. Szozas sits silently for a moment, his eyes fixed upon me.\nThen he asks, very quietly, almost shyly, \"What happens next?\"\nI try to collect my thoughts, to find words that will describe what I am experiencing. But I am having trouble finding any way to put into words what I am feeling. Finally, I answer, \"I get really scared, but I also feel excited, anxious, confused. There are times when I want to scream out, but there are other moments where I feel calm, peaceful. Sometimes I am happy; sometimes sad. I am not sure",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Ashley Smith.\" My heart pounds harder, and my breathing becomes shallow.\nHe nods, \"OK then, let's get started...\" And he looks away, back to his computer screen...\nDr. Szozas spends the next hour asking questions, and listening intently while I answer them. At one point, I tell him about my parents divorce, and my subsequent move across the country to live with my father. He asks me more questions about this, but doesn't seem too interested in talking about my mother. When I talk about living with my dad, he smiles softly, and tells me that he thinks we should go ahead and schedule an appointment to meet with her. She had better be ready for what she's getting herself into.\nAs our time together draws to an end, he stands up, and offers me his hand again. This time, instead of taking it, I stand up myself, and offer mine. He shakes my hand firmly, and gives me another smile that makes me feel all warm inside. It was such a nice gesture, and I think to myself, 'Maybe there really IS something wrong with me!'\nWe walk out into the hallway, where he opens his office door, \"If you don't mind, would you please come by my house tomorrow morning? We'll have breakfast, and I can explain things to you in greater detail, and if I've missed anything, or if you still want to see me after that, I'd be happy to continue the discussion. I'm free until noon, but I might be able to squeeze you in later if that works for you?\"\nI nod, \"Sure, that sounds good to me!\"\nAnd that's how I met Dr. Szozas, and that's how I found out that I'm not crazy, or even unusual. That I just need help. I thought I was going to die that night when I went to bed, but I slept well that night",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Emma Smith.\" My heart beats faster, and my face flushes. This isn't supposed to happen this way...is it?\nHe smiles again, and leans back in his chair, resting his hands on his lap, \"Why don't we start by talking about what brought you to my office today?\"\nOh God, I can feel myself blushing deeper now, and I stutter, \"Well, uhm...\" I glance away, then look back at him, \"...I guess I just wanted to know if there was anything wrong with me, because, um, lately I've been having really bad headaches, and I think they might have something to do with, er, my sexual activity. And I was wondering if maybe those were symptoms of an STD or something.\"\nDr. Szozas nods, \"Yes, yes, that sounds very much like one of the possible reasons that people seek out counseling. Please continue telling me about your concerns.\" He pauses briefly, before adding, \"But let me assure you that what happened to you, while not exactly normal, was certainly within acceptable parameters. It's quite common for women to experience orgasm during intercourse without any stimulation whatsoever.\"\nI gulp, \"Really? Oh wow!\" I blush even more deeply. The doctor continues, \"Do you recall when that started happening?\"\n\"Um, about three weeks ago, after I had sex with Mark,\" I reply.\nThe doctor raises his eyebrows slightly, and asks me, \"What did you call him? I assume that wasn't his real name, right?\"\n\"Uh-huh! Yeah! His name is David. We met at work, and I thought he seemed nice enough, but when we got home together, well...\" I trail off, unable to explain to Dr. Szozas how I felt about our relationship.\nThe psychiatrist chuckles, \"That makes sense, but I'm going to need to hear about that later",

   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Amy.\"\nHe nods, encouragingly, and then asks, \"And why did you decide to seek help?\"\nSo I tell him my story. How I've been feeling different since last year, that I can't seem to get myself motivated, that I feel anxious all the time, that I have trouble sleeping... And more details than that. He listens attentively, nodding now and again, asking questions only occasionally, until I finish telling my tale.\nThen he looks up at me, and smiles, \"That certainly sounds very troubling indeed. What do you think? Have you ever heard of any such symptoms before?\"\nI shake my head, \"No, never.\"\nDr. Szozas taps his chin thoughtfully, pondering this, \"Have you had any recent life changes or stressors that might account for these feelings?\"\nAgain, I shake my head. The doctor reaches out, and pats me gently on the shoulder, \"It's understandable that you may not want to discuss anything related to your past, but if there were something that happened recently, even just several weeks ago, please let me know. I'd be happy to help you sort through what might be causing those issues. It could be helpful for both of us.\"\nI nod, still hesitant to talk about things from years gone by. But Dr. Szozas continues, \"Do you mind if we go ahead and start with a series of simple cognitive tests, to see where our discussion goes from here?\"\nI answer, \"Yes, I don't mind at all,\" with a smile.\nThe test results are surprising:\nFirst, the IQ scores are average; but then Dr. Szozas explains that they are probably skewed because I was raised in a home without much education. He is right; I was taught to read, but I learned nothing else. My parents didn't believe that school would benefit me, and so I was left to",
