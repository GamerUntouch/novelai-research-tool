Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

It sounds very strange when I say it out loud, but Dr. Szazas just listens attentively until I finish. When I finally run out of steam, he pauses for a moment before speaking again.\n\"You know, there are lots of ways to lose touch with reality: drugs, alcohol, gambling, sex addictions, etc. But usually people don't get this far without something else happening too,\" he observes thoughtfully. He looks back up at me with those warm hazel eyes. \"Have you ever experienced any trauma recently? Something bad that happened to you?\"\n\"Yes, I guess so,\" I admit reluctantly. The doctor seems to sense that I'm not being entirely forthcoming, and prompts me further with another question.\n\"What was it that made you want to seek professional help?\"\nOh God, I can't believe I said that out loud! I blurt out the truth, \"It was when I saw the video of that poor girl getting raped!\"\nThe man sitting across from me doesn't even flinch.
