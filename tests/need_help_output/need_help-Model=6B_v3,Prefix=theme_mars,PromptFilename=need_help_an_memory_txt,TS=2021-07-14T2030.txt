=== Prompt ========================================
I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
[Period: Modern Day]
[Year: 2020 AD]
[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "


=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Amanda Llewellyn. I work at the University of Arizona Medical Center, where I have worked since 2012. My job involves working with patients, which includes taking care of their physical needs, but also more importantly, helping them deal with mental health issues.  I've been dealing with some things myself lately."
He nods, encouragingly, "And what do you think those 'things' might be?"
I pause again, this time I look away, "Well... I'm not sure. It feels like there is something missing, and I don't know if it is because of the divorce or maybe just a phase that I am going through..."
Dr. Szozas leans forward, "Amanda, please tell me about the divorce."
I sigh deeply, "We were married for five years. We met when we both had our residency at the same hospital. I was a surgical resident at the time, and he was a psychiatry resident. He was a year ahead of me, and we hit it off really well. I was a big fan of his writing, and I thought he was really smart. I was attracted to his mind and intellect, his confidence and charisma, and I was smitten.
I was twenty-three at the time, and I was still living at home, I was a virgin, and I was really naive; I was never interested in sex before, and I was too young to even get a boyfriend. I fell for John, and I got pregnant. I did the right thing and went to my parents for help, and they helped us out financially. I was an only child, and my mother was very worried, so she bought me a house in the suburbs, and I moved into a nice little place.
John and I started to date, and I loved the way he treated me; I felt special, and I didn't feel like I needed to hide anything from him. He would read

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Amber Kowalski. My last name rhymes with 'cow'. I live in New York City."
He nods, and smiles again, "You said that already. Why do you want to meet with me?"
I swallow hard, feeling nervous about this whole thing, "Well... um..." I stutter, trying to figure out what to say next, "Um, I guess I have a problem. It's been bothering me for a while now. I've tried talking to friends, family, co-workers, but nobody knows what to do for me."
Dr. Szozas sits forward, "Can you tell me more? What exactly is the issue that you are having? I would need to know more details before I can give any advice or treatment recommendations."
So I try to explain myself, telling him a little bit about my life, my problems, my relationships, my career, my hopes and dreams. I describe my situation, and my feelings.  
I feel better after I finish describing my situation.  
I really don't think I'm crazy. I'm not sure if I should seek help from a doctor, psychologist, psychiatrist, counselor, therapist, etc., 
But then I remember that I was sent by the website, and I realize I must follow through on my appointment. I stand up to leave, "Thank you, I'll call you when I get home tonight. Bye!"
I walk out the door and into the waiting room. I am still nervous, I feel a sense of dread in my stomach as I wait for the elevator to arrive. I enter the elevator, and I reach out to push the button for the ground floor. The doors open and I step out into the lobby. I turn to the left, and head towards the exit. I stop at the door and look back into the building, and I see Dr. Szozas standing there in the hallway,

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Alyssa Friesen." 
He nods, and then asks, "And why are you here?"
Well, this is awkward. How do I explain myself? Should I tell him all about the recent events leading up to today? Maybe not... maybe just start with what happened yesterday?
So I begin, "Yesterday morning..." I pause, searching for words, trying to find the right way to phrase things, "I woke up early, and went to work. I got off work at 6pm, and took a shower. When I came out of the bathroom, there was a note on my pillow telling me that I had an appointment with a doctor named 'Michael Szozas', at 8pm. It said, 'Be prompt!'
I get dressed, and I head out the door; I grab a cab, and go to the address on the note. I walk up the stairs and ring the bell, and a young woman answers the door. She tells me to wait a moment, and she disappears inside.
After a few minutes, a man appears, and welcomes me into his office. I follow him in, and we shake hands. He introduces himself as Dr. Michael Szozas, and I introduce myself, "I'm sorry, I don't believe I've met before."
"No, I'm afraid not. I have a feeling I'll be seeing a lot more of you soon. Please, take a seat on the sofa," he invites.
I sit, and I realize I am staring at his chest; the top button on his shirt is undone, revealing a smooth expanse of his pale, hairless chest, topped by a pair of perky nipples. I can feel my face flush red, and I look away, embarrassed.
I try to focus on the conversation, but my mind wanders, and I become distracted. I'm getting hard, and I'm not sure if I should

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Tessa Robinson." My last name sounds foreign, but I don't know where it came from. I have brown hair, which I keep short because I want to save money on haircuts. It isn't long enough to bother cutting, though. I also wear contacts, but I haven't had them adjusted yet. I don't have any piercings or tattoos, either. I've never been married, and I don't plan to ever get married. I'm 28 years old, and I work as a waitress at a local restaurant. I live alone in an apartment complex called The Villages.
I go on, "   I wanted to talk to you about my feelings for another woman, and what that means."
Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding at my responses. I continue, "I met this girl, her name is Emma, she works at the same restaurant I do. She is very beautiful, and I think I might be in love with her. I can't stop thinking about her, and I feel guilty, and I need help!"
He nods again, "OK, I understand. You say you are in love, and you wish to express those feelings for the other person? That's perfectly normal. What is causing the guilt?"
I explain, "Well, I'm afraid I will hurt her if I tell her how I really feel. I'm worried that I'll lose the relationship if I do."
"Do you believe the relationship is important to you?"
I nod, "Yes, I'd be devastated if I lost the connection we share. I worry I won't find anyone else who is so compatible with me. I guess I just need some advice, help!"
Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair, and rubs his chin, "I'm going to ask a few questions to determine whether or not I should recommend therapy for you. If you answer honestly,

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Michelle Smith."
He nods, and then asks, "And why do you think you should see me?"
I pause again, because I don't know what to say... but then something occurs to me. I've been thinking about this for quite awhile now, and I have some ideas, so I share them, "Well, I guess I just want to talk. I want to get some clarity on my life, and I'd really appreciate any help that I can get."
Dr. Szozas smiles, and looks at me thoughtfully for a moment before replying, "OK, let's start by talking about your childhood."
So we begin our session, and I tell him about growing up in a small town called Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin. We discuss my parents, and their divorce when I was 10.  They had been married for almost 20 years when they divorced, which was shocking to all of us. My father was an alcoholic, and was physically abusive toward my mother, and I was witness to most of the abuse. The abuse was verbal at first, and escalated into physical violence.  I was a victim, and I was afraid to speak up or to intervene on my behalf when my mom would try to stop the abuse. 
We also discussed my older brother Mark, who was a year and a half younger than I was. He was a sweet boy, a little shy, and a good kid. But I knew that he was being bullied at school for his size, and I wanted to protect him from the bullies. I didn't realize at the time that my actions were making things worse for my big bro, not better.
As I recall, I was a very smart girl, and I did well in my classes.  I went on to attend the University of Milwaukee, and I majored in psychology, and minored in English. I loved my studies and I enjoyed my professors. I graduated with

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is  . I'm twenty years old, and I live alone."
He nods, "And do you have any family members?"
I shake my head, "No, none left. My parents were killed in a car accident when I was fourteen. They died instantly, and there wasn't anything they could do about it."
He pauses, then asks gently, "Is this something you want to talk about? It doesn't matter what happened, but we can start anywhere if you'd like."
I nod, "It was a long time ago. I don't remember much of what happened after the crash... I've been seeing a counselor since I was thirteen, and she suggested that I try to contact my mother's side of the family. The only living relative is a cousin, a woman named  . She lives in Chicago, Illinois. I wanted to meet her, and maybe find out more about my father, and where he came from."
Dr. Szozas is nodding along at my words, and I continue, "So I went to visit her, and I got to know her pretty well. We became friends, and I asked her for help finding out more about my dad. I found out that my dad had a sister, and I tracked her down. I flew out to visit, and I met my aunt, and I learned a lot about my dad. I found out that my dad was adopted, and his real name is  . He didn't tell me his last name, and I never found out. I think his adoptive mom might have told him to keep it a secret because my grandfather would not approve of his choice. I just thought it was a shame.
I also discovered that my grandfather is my biological uncle. I don't even know my biological grandparents, or my biological parents for that matter. All I know is that I'm a half-blood, and I'm trying to figure out who my blood relatives are

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Adrienne, and I came here because I'm having trouble figuring something out." 
He nods, "Go ahead..."
So I tell him about my problem, and I explain what I've done online...and then he asks me questions. Why do I think this is happening? What is bothering me? How did I get started thinking this way? Where does it come from? Am I trying to please others? Do I want attention? Is there any other reason I might have a thought process like this? 
Then, he listens intently while I try to describe my thoughts and feelings. He asks follow-up questions, and I give more details. I can feel myself relaxing in his presence, and I find that I don't mind talking to him at all. It feels good to talk to somebody, to share my concerns and fears and hopes and dreams. I begin to open up to him, and I reveal things I haven't shared with anybody else.
After a half hour, I realize I'm getting tired, and I ask if we should stop for today. "No, I'd really rather keep going. I'm enjoying this, and I really need help. I just want to know what I am, and where I'm going wrong. I really want to figure out the source of my problems, and I hope I'll be able to work through them. I'm not sure if I'll ever be cured, but I want to learn the root cause of my issues. I'd also like to understand the mechanics of my brain better, and I'm hoping Dr. Szozas will help me with that. I'm not sure if I'm ready to commit to therapy yet, though. I'm still working on my self-confidence, and I'm scared to trust anyone enough to let them inside my head. But I do believe I'm worth the effort, and I'm willing to put in the time and energy required to

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Amy Davenport." I pause, then continue, "I'm twenty years old. I live in San Francisco, California. My boyfriend broke up with me last week, and now I don't know what to do..." I feel myself getting emotional, and I start to sob, tears running down my cheeks.
Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair, and smiles sympathetically, "It sounds like you've been through quite an ordeal recently, Ms. Amy. Do you have any family nearby? A parent?" I shake my head sadly, "Is there anyone else that can help you out right now? Someone you trust?" I nod, "Yes... yes, I think so..."
Dr. Szozas nods, and leans forward intently, "What would happen if we were to perform a psychological evaluation on you to determine if this was a normal break-up or something more serious, perhaps even an episode of depression, or anxiety, or a combination of those things?"
I nod again, and I begin to tell him about my life, my past relationships, my friends, my work, my hobbies, my fears, my hopes, my dreams, and my aspirations. I am surprised by how much I talk, and I am relieved to get the words out. I want to share my story with a caring person, a good listener. I also realize that I really need a friend right now. I never had one, and I'm not sure I ever will. I'm scared to death of being alone, and I don't understand how I got to where I am.
I finish telling my tale, and I watch Dr. Szozas' face. He looks at me carefully, and I sense a sadness in his eyes. I wonder if I'm boring him, or if I'm making a fool out of myself.
He asks me to stand up, and he leads me over to the door. He opens

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Mary Jane Watson."
He nods, and asks, "And why have you decided to seek counseling?"
Oh boy. This is where I get nervous again. I've never really talked about this before, and now I find myself opening up to this handsome older gent. I feel my face flush red, and I stutter, "Umm...well, ummm..." I try to gather my thoughts.
"You don't need to worry about being embarrassed, Miss Watson. You can tell me anything," he assures me.
So I continue, "Well, uhm..uhm..um...I guess I just needed help." My heart pounds a little faster. 
Dr. Szozas leans back in his chair, and looks at me for a moment, then he smiles, "Tell me more about that. Why do you think you need to talk to a counselor? Do you know what the problem is?"
I nod, "Yes, I do. It's called 'unrequited love.' I have a crush on a guy named Peter Parker, but I haven't done anything to show that I like him yet. I want to, but I'm afraid to say something because I might scare him away or hurt his feelings. I also know that if I did act on my attraction to him, I would lose my friends and my family. I'm scared to even admit that I like him or to actually date him. I'm terrified that I'll end up hurting him, and I'm worried that I won't be able to live up to his expectations. I'm not sure what I should do, but I'm starting to realize that I am falling for the guy, and I'm having a hard time figuring out if I'm in love with him, and I'm trying to figure out how to deal with all of these mixed emotions. I know I shouldn't fall in love with a man, especially one who is already

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Anna, and I've been having problems." My voice sounds small and scared, but I continue, "I just don't know what to do about them..."
He nods, "And what have you done?"
"Well... nothing really. It started back in college, after I had a bad breakup with my boyfriend. I was depressed for months, and then one day I woke up and realized that I wanted to kill myself. I thought about doing something drastic, but I didn't want to die. So I decided to go to therapy, hoping that talking would help me get better. The therapist suggested a few things, but they all seemed too extreme for me. I ended up quitting the sessions without ever getting any answers or solutions."
Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding occasionally to indicate that I should proceed. "So I was left to my own devices, which was probably a mistake. I was angry and confused, and I did a lot of self-destructive stuff, including smoking cigarettes and binge eating food. I was also pretty lonely, because I wasn't able to find anyone else to talk to about my issues. I found a group online, and we became friends. I confided in my new friend, Sarah, about my depression, and she said that I needed to try to connect with people. She was right; I was feeling very isolated and alone, and I felt that I was being punished by life. I made a list of the worst people in my life, and I tried to figure out a way to remove them from my life. I used to smoke, and I got rid of my pack, but I still found a reason to be upset and I quit the group. I was miserable, and I stopped going to therapy. Then I moved out west, and I went on a diet, lost weight, and got healthy. But I kept thinking about my old friendships, and wondering if maybe I made a huge
