  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

It's really starting to affect my grades, which isn't good because I need to graduate soon. Can we talk about this?\"\nHe nods thoughtfully, \"Yes, please tell me more about your problem, Ginny. What do you normally do before bed? Do you have any rituals or habits that might be causing issues?\"\nSo I start talking, describing my nightly routine, and how I feel sleepy right away after getting home from work. He asks questions, and I answer them honestly. I describe the dreams I had, and I explain that they were always the same dream: I was walking through a forest, and there was something chasing me. At times, I would wake up screaming, sometimes I'd just wake up, and go back to sleep. I also described waking up feeling hot and sweaty, and that I felt lightheaded. And I explained about the nightmares. The doctor listened intently to all I said, occasionally asking clarifying questions.\nAfter I finished, he asked, \"Do you think you are a morning person by nature, Ginny?\"\nI nodded slowly, \"Yeah, I guess I am. I'm usually wide-awake at 6am when I get out of bed, but I don't know if that's a normal thing to be doing. I'm not sure what to call it; I'm definitely an early riser, but I'm not sure about the other stuff. I'm an insomniac, I suppose.\"\nDr. Szozas smiled at me, \"Well, that explains the insomnia, but it doesn't explain the rest of the symptoms that you mentioned",

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

Tell me about yourself, where you live, who raised you? What school did you go to?\"\nSo I begin telling him about myself: growing up in the suburbs with two parents and a brother; living with them in an apartment complex near downtown; high school graduation, then college; working part-time while taking classes online at night. He asks questions about each topic, and I answer without hesitation. I feel safe talking to him; I feel as though I am being listened to with interest, not just a clinical assessment.\nAfter a few minutes of chatting with Dr. Szozas, I realize that I am starting to relax. I'm not sure whether I am really relaxed, or I am simply tired from the lack of sleep; I am definitely getting sleepy. I yawn once, twice, three times.\n\"Sorry about that; I guess I'm a little sleepy. I'm not sure when I last slept more than four hours at a stretch,\" I say sheepishly.\n\"It's OK, I understand.

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is ... uh... 'Sookie Stackhouse',\" I say hesitantly. My heart races. Why did I choose this name? Is it because I want to be different than everyone else? Or is it just because I've always been called Sookie since childhood? It doesn't matter; what does matter is that I have to tell him my story now.\nHe nods encouragingly, waiting patiently. \"And why do you think you came here?\"\nSo I start talking, telling him all about my life, the good parts and the bad parts. How I was born in Louisiana, where I grew up, went to college, met Eric, married Bill, had children, got divorced (not before having sex with a vampire), moved to Hotshot, Texas, found out that my brother was alive after all, became friends with Sam, discovered that vampires were real, tried to get along with them, learned their language, took care of a very special girl named Amelia, and then she died. And that was only the beginning.\nDr. Szozas listens intently to me without interruption until I finish. He leans forward to rest his elbows on his knees, his hands clasped together. \"You seem to be doing pretty well, considering.\"\nI shrug. I guess I should be grateful that I'm not being judged for a mental breakdown or something. But I don't feel happy about the fact that I can't remember anything from the last few months.\n\"What about the past several years?\" he asks.\nThis is not a question I expected to be asked. I thought I'd be able to answer that one easily enough. I didn't know if I wanted to talk about that either. I look away from his face, to the floor, and I begin to speak:\n\"I started working at Merlotte's when I graduated high school. I worked there for five or six years, and I met a guy named Jason",

He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

Would I really want to go through life being laughed at by everyone?\nThen I remember something: \"Dr. Szozas, I have a problem with heights.\" I explain, \"When I try to get up onto anything higher than two feet off the ground, I start to panic, and I can't breathe right. It feels like there's a giant weight pressing against my chest.\"\nHe nods, and he listens intently to me. \"That sounds very similar to symptoms I've seen in patients with a condition called acrophobia.
