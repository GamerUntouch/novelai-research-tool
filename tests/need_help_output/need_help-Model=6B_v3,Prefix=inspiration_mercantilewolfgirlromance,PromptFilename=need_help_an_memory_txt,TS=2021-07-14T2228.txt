=== Prompt ========================================
I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.

[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "


=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Myra."
He smiles broadly, "That's quite lovely, but I believe we should begin by getting to know each other better. Please tell me something about yourself."
So I start talking. And this is what I say...
Chapter 2: The Girl Who Loved Money
* * *
I grew up in a town called New Jerusalem, which is located in a small farming community near the southern border of the Kingdom of Winfiel. We were a poor family, but I had a good upbringing nonetheless. I was raised by a single mother after my parents passed away when I was young. She worked hard to raise us both and never let us go hungry. 
When I turned ten years old, she got sick, and her condition deteriorated rapidly. It was clear that she would not survive much longer, so I decided I needed to move out. I found a job at a bakery and saved up enough money to pay for my own room and board. I moved into an apartment in the city, where I found work at a clothing store. I didn't have a lot of friends there, since most of them were the sons and daughters of the wealthy. I did find one friend, a girl named Elin, though.
She was very pretty and sweet, and I enjoyed spending time with her. Our relationship became more than just friendship, however; I started to feel a little guilty because I was dating a younger woman. I wasn't sure if that made me a bad person or not.
Elin also liked to gamble; I don't think she knew how to handle the odds well, but she loved playing the lottery. That is when I learned that the price for a ticket is five gold coins. I remember being shocked at the cost, and then I asked her if I could buy a few tickets for myself. I won three times, and I thought I was a lucky man.
I wanted to celebrate my luck and

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Lawrence."
He nods thoughtfully, then asks, "And why are you here?"
Oh dear...what do I say? I've been doing this long enough now that I know what people want to hear, but I don't think I can tell him anything interesting about myself. My head spins, trying to figure out where to start. The fact that I have a job, I guess, would be good. 
I answer, "Well, I work at a bank, and I recently became aware of something strange happening there."
Dr. Szozas smiles knowingly, "Go on..."
So I explain to him, briefly, about the oddities occurring at my workplace. He listens attentively, nodding occasionally, asking a few questions along the way. At one point, he stands up, and begins pacing back and forth across the room.
After a minute or two, I ask, "What is it that you think I should talk about next?"
He pauses and looks at me, and I sense that he is thinking deeply. I wait patiently, feeling that my life is on the line. Finally he speaks, "How much money did you bring with you today, Mr. Lawrence?"
I blink, and I stare at him. "Uh, I didn't come to discuss my finances. I came to discuss my mental health."
Dr. Szozas chuckles, and his eyes crinkle at the corners. "Ah, yes, I understand. Well, let's not worry about the details for a moment. I'll just need to get a better idea of the situation, and I'd like to meet your coworkers as well. I will, however, require that you come in tomorrow for a follow-up session, after which we can discuss any further issues."
I nod slowly. "Yes, I suppose so. But why does all this matter? What is it that you suspect might be wrong with me

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Lawrence."
He nods, "And why have you sought counseling?"
I don't know where to begin. It feels awkward to talk about myself. My family is poor, we struggle each month just to survive. The truth is, I want to get better, but I can't seem to do anything right.
Dr. Szozas continues, "It may help if you tell me what brought you here today."
I sigh, and I say, "Well, I had this...uh, this..."
"A dream? A vision?"
"Yes," I nod.
Dr. Szozas looks at me, then smiles again, "That is quite common. What did the dream show you?"
I pause for a moment, then I continue, "I was walking along a road at night. I saw a beautiful girl, dressed in a white dress. She seemed very sad, and she was crying. Her hair was long, and her face was pale and drawn. I couldn't hear her words, only the sound of her weeping."
I stop for a second, thinking back to the scene. I remember the way the wind was blowing the hem of the white dress, and the way the moonlight shone through the fabric and onto the ground. I remembered the feel of the cold air on my cheeks, the scent of the flowers nearby, and the taste of the water in my mouth.
Then I continued, "She was walking away, and I was afraid to follow. I wanted to go after her, to comfort her, but I didn't know how I was supposed to reach out to her. I thought that if I followed, I would lose sight of her forever.
I felt like I needed to reach out and touch the hem of the white dress, and I reached for the material. I touched it, and I tried to move closer, and when I got close enough, I noticed a small tear in

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Myne Lawrence."
He nods slowly, and then he asks, "And why have you chosen to consult with me?"
Well, this is where things get weird. I tell him about my problems with my family, and I try to explain them as best I can, but I don't really understand what's happening myself. I keep getting confused, and I feel lost, and I start to panic. It all feels too real, and I've never felt anything like this before. I want to go home, back to my house, back to the life that I know. I want to go home.
But I also realize that if I do leave, there will only be more pain waiting for me when I return. And maybe I'll find something different waiting for me, or worse yet, I might not even recognize the person I used to be when I returned. I think I need help. I need help understanding what is happening to me, because I just don't know.
Dr. Szozas listens quietly, and when I finish, he replies, "So, I gather that the problem is not an external one? That is to say, not a problem in the world outside, but rather a psychological or emotional issue. Is that correct, Miss Lawrence?"
I nod, "Yes, sir. But I don't understand. Why would I need a psychiatrist to help me sort out my issues when I already have a good relationship with my parents, and a pretty decent job at the mine, and a great boyfriend, and I'm in a healthy place mentally, emotionally, and physically? I should not be in a situation where I need a psychiatrist. I'm fine. I am in a position of strength. I'm strong, and my mind is clear. I'm happy, and I'm loved, and I'm living the way I want to live. I shouldn't be in a situation where I need a doctor. I'm

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Lawrence Collet, and I've been having issues."
He nods slowly, and then asks, "What sort of problems?"
So I tell him about the issue, and what I did to try and resolve it. And I mention that I had gone to a doctor before coming to him. He listens intently to all that I have said, nodding along occasionally, and when I finish, he sits back in his chair and looks at me.
"And this problem began after you went to a different doctor? Before you came here?"
I nod.   "It started when I got engaged to my fiancée, Maryanne, two years ago..."
Dr. Szozas smiles kindly at me and continues listening. I continue talking, telling him the details of our relationship. When I was done, he stands up and walks to the window, and turns his head away. He sighs, and I hear the sound of his fingers rubbing together, and I can't help but feel a little self-conscious. He returns and leans forward, placing his elbows on the desk in front of him, and his hands clasped between his knees. He looks at me, and I find myself staring at his face.
"Mr. Collet, I know this is difficult, but I'm going to ask you a question. If I were to tell you that I believe you, would that help you get better?"
I think for a moment, and I reply, "Yes, I'd really appreciate that."
He grins, and I return the smile, "I don't want to pry, Mr. Collet, and I'm sure that you already realize this, but I'm not a therapist. I do specialize in unusual cases, however, and I believe I may be able to provide some assistance. I'll need to talk to you for a while, and I recommend you go home and relax. You can call

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Colby."
He nods slowly, then asks, "And why did you seek counseling?"
It feels odd answering this question, since I've never had anyone ask such questions before, but I feel compelled to do so.   "Because I can't sleep," I say honestly.
Dr. Szozas looks surprised, but not judgmental. Perhaps he thinks I'm joking?
"Have you ever heard of insomnia, Mr. Collier?" he inquires, and I nod.
"Yes...it means 'not sleeping,'" I explain.
"Right, yes, I know what it means," he responds, sounding almost exasperated.
Dr. Szozas stands up and begins pacing back and forth, making his way to a window where he leans against the sill. He continues, "Insomnia is an extremely common condition, and it's not something that should concern you. You'll have to tell me more about the situation that leads you to seek my services. I don't want to waste any time if I can help you. What is the source of your problem?"
I'm not sure if I should answer his question directly. I was hoping to get a few hints from him, and I'm not sure if I should give too much away. "I was thinking of asking my parents for help, but I wasn't sure if I was ready to talk to them yet..." I admit.
He turns to face me, and his eyes are piercing, "I think you should be honest with your family, and I'd recommend doing it sooner rather than later. It's not healthy for a child to keep secrets from their parent; I believe that they will grow up to become adults who lie to themselves and others."
I hadn't considered the possibility of telling my parents; I guess he's right. I swallow, and I take a deep breath, and I begin my story.
I start out by describing

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Lawrence, and I came because I have been experiencing strange feelings."
He nods, then asks, "What do you feel?"
"Well, I don't know if they can even be called 'feelings,' but...they are difficult to describe. They seem very similar to what I felt before, only more intense. Like I've had a great meal, and now I want nothing but dessert. It feels almost like I'm being pulled in two different directions. My mind is confused, and I find myself wanting to cry or laugh at the same time. And there's something else too..."
"Yes? What is this other feeling?"
I pause, and try to explain, "It's hard to put into words. But I think it's a sense of anxiety."
Dr. Szozas raises an eyebrow, "Anxiety, hmm. That sounds about right. You were saying that the intensity was greater than that which you experienced before?"
I nod slowly, "That's exactly correct. Before, I would experience a desire to cry, or laughter, and sometimes both. Now, I just get a general sense of unease. I also feel a strong need to speak. I wish to tell people, and yet I am terrified to open my mouth. I'd rather remain silent and alone, and I hate that. I hate the fact that I cannot control my own body and emotions. I feel trapped, unable to move, and I want to scream and shout and run away. I want to go somewhere far, far away where no one knows my name. I want to escape. I want to live in a world that is free and unbound, a place without rules and regulations, and I long to be able to talk about these things. I need help, and I hope you will provide it for me."
Dr. Szozas listens intently, and his eyes show his concern and sympathy. He leans forward

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Colby, and I came today because..."
He nods, and asks, "What brought you here?"
And I answer, "Well...it started last week."
Then we talk. And talk. And talk. I feel like I've known this guy forever. It feels weird talking about myself to somebody I just met, but there's something comforting about being able to tell this stranger all about what happened. He listens intently, nodding or making comments now and then. When I get to the end, he smiles again, "So, do you have any questions for me? If not, I can ask you anything else."
I nod, "Yes, please, ask me whatever you want."
"Do you think that the world is getting worse, or better?"
I pause. I guess I should consider my thoughts before answering. I don't know if I agree with the question, and I really don't know if I believe it either way. But I also think I shouldn't let the doctor worry, and I say, "I really don't know. I don't think anyone knows for sure. I really hope the world is getting better, though."
Dr. Szozas laughs, and I smile back. "I'd love to hear more, but I understand if you need time to process. I'll wait patiently, and if I'm bothering you, I promise to leave. I will always respect your privacy and confidentiality, and I would never reveal a single word to a third party. You may trust me implicitly. 
I realize I am smiling, and I blink a few times. I look at the man, and I wonder if I ever looked at him that way. I'm sure I did, and I laugh a little. "I, uh, thanks for saying that. I really appreciate it. I'm sorry, I was staring at you, and I didn't mean to be rude. I

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Holo."
He nods, and then asks, "And what brings you to me?"
I answer, "I have been experiencing symptoms of depression."
A pause. He looks thoughtful, and after another moment, he responds, "Well, let's get right to work, shall we? Why don't you tell me about what brought this on?"
So I begin to talk, and I do indeed find myself getting teary eyed, but I continue talking, and I feel better.  There is something very comforting about speaking to a professional, especially one that can help. When I finish my story, I ask, "What should I expect next?"
Dr. Szozas smiles again, "It depends on you. Are you ready to face the challenge ahead?"
I nod.
"Good, good. Now, before we go any further, I want to confirm two things for the record. First, I am not a psychologist, nor a psychiatrist. I specialize in the treatment of mental illness. I also serve as a counselor for the military. Second, I will not charge you for our session. You may pay however much you wish. I know how difficult financial times are for many people, and I would not dream of taking advantage of a person in need. In fact, I would consider it an honor to be able to assist a fellow human being in their time of need. So if you choose, I will gladly accept whatever amount is in your wallet.
I thank him for his generosity, and I say, "I'll take the deal."
With a smile, he replies, "Excellent! Let's start by discussing the nature of the problem at hand. What is it exactly that you think is wrong with you?"
I explain, "I'm not sure. I've tried to describe the feeling to others, and they all just look at me blankly. I've never had a friend or loved one who

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Lawrence."
He nods, and then responds, "And?"
It feels strange being asked such questions, but I answer, "And...I've been having problems sleeping lately."
"Anything unusual happening? Any changes in lifestyle? What time do you usually go to bed each night? Do you have any trouble falling asleep?"
I tell him what I can remember about my sleep cycle, and I explain that I had gotten used to getting up at 6am, but recently I'd fallen back to waking up at 7 or 8am instead.
"Do you find yourself feeling tired during the day?"
I nod.
"You don't feel sleepy at all after dinner, correct?"
Again I nod.   "Have you ever heard of a condition called narcolepsy?"
I shake my head.
"Narcolepsy is a disorder where the brain stops functioning properly, causing the body to stop producing melatonin. The problem is, that the mind does not get enough rest and the person falls asleep at inappropriate times. In addition to this, the patient may experience sudden and uncontrollable episodes of muscle weakness and paralysis, known as cataplexy.
If you think that sounds scary, I agree. It is indeed a terrifying disease, and many people die from it. However, there is a treatment, and I will be able to cure you. Now, I want to ask you a few things. How old are you?"
I am a little surprised by the question. I hadn't thought much past the fact that I was a young adult. I reply, "Twenty-one. Why is that important?"
Dr. Szozas smiles, "I'm just making sure we understand one another. I need to know a few more details before I begin the process. Please, tell me when you were born. You mentioned you have a younger sister, and she is seventeen, right?"
I nod,
