=== Prompt ========================================
I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.

[Year: 2020 AD]
[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "


=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Laura Lavinia Baker."
He nods, then continues, "Go ahead, please continue."
"Well, I've been seeing this guy named John Smith, and we started dating last year..."
"John Smith?" asks Dr. Szozas, "That sounds very familiar."
"Yeah... yeah it does," I say, "but he's not really my boyfriend. We just have sex sometimes, but I don't know what to do about our relationship. I want to break up with him, but I can't figure out how."
Dr. Szozas looks at me for a moment, pondering, and then responds, "Laura, I think you should start by describing exactly what happened between you two. Start at the beginning."
So I tell him, and I describe the whole situation, and I get to the part where I said, "I'd rather fuck a dead fish than go out to dinner with you again. Goodbye forever!"
And he replies, "Oh dear," and he shakes his head at me, "You are such a bitch. I cannot believe that you would say something like that to him."
I stare at him, and I ask, "What? Why?"
He sighs, and answers, "Because he is a good man, and because he is a gentleman. You treat him badly, and you hurt him deeply. I wish I had more time to explain things to you, but I am afraid I must be brief. I will give you a few moments to collect yourself before I begin."
As I nod, I realize that I feel a little ashamed of myself; I was the one who broke up with him, and I didn't even bother to try to apologize. But now I'm the one sitting in his office, and I'm the one being counseled. I wonder if I'll ever live that down.
I look at my watch; I'm a bit

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Bethany Davis." My parents were killed by a drunk driver years ago, and I've been living off their life insurance policy ever since. It pays very little, but I don't need much money.
"That's quite a story, Miss Davis. You have a lot of courage to come all this way just to talk about something that may seem trivial to others, but not to you. I'm sure you know what I'm talking about, because you said 'my situation'. Do you feel trapped? Is there a reason for feeling stuck?" The doctor asks, leaning forward intently.
I nod slowly, trying to find the right words. "Yes, yes I do. Yes, I feel trapped. But not by anything physical, Doctor. I feel... I feel confined. I feel hemmed in. I feel that I can't move, and I feel that I'm suffocating. I want to get out, I want to go somewhere where I'll be able to breathe again, I want to live my own life. I feel trapped, I feel imprisoned, I feel smothered. I can't stand being in my house anymore. I feel claustrophobic, I hate my job, I hate my apartment, I hate my city, I hate my country. I'm sick of having to wait in line at the grocery store, I'm tired of watching the news, I'm fed up with hearing the same old songs, I'm bored out of my mind listening to the same old people. I'm scared to death, and I'm angry too, I'm mad at the world for taking away my freedom, and I'm mad at myself for allowing them to do it to me. I'm afraid to leave my home, I'm terrified that I won't be able to survive out in the big bad scary world. I'm a prisoner, I'm a slave, I'm in chains. I need help, I need to

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is John Doe."
He nods, "And why do you think you're here?"
I pause again, "To find out what happened to my wife and son."
He raises an eyebrow, "Your wife and child were killed by a bear, correct?"
Oh God, this isn't real. This can't be happening to me. I've been dreaming about them all night. I shake my head, "No, they weren't killed by a bear."
"How did they die then? Did the bear kill them?"
I shake my head, "They didn't die at all. They're alive, and I just want to know what the hell is wrong with me."
Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair and rubs his chin thoughtfully, "Well, Mr. Doe, let's start at the beginning, shall we?"
I sigh, "Alright."
So I tell him the whole story, starting at the very beginning when I met my wife and our son, and I go through the events leading up to the day I was attacked. He listens intently, asking questions, occasionally writing something on a notepad. After I finish, he looks up at me and asks, "Do you have any other symptoms besides the ones that I mentioned before, such as headaches, nausea, insomnia, or anything else that might indicate a problem?"
I scratch my cheek, "I don't really get the feeling that I'm sick, I guess. I'm not sure if I'm suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, or if I'm having a nervous breakdown, but I feel a lot of pressure, and I'm constantly thinking, wondering if I'll ever see my family again. I also hear voices in my mind sometimes, and I'm afraid I'm losing my sanity."
I stare at my hands in my lap, "I'm sorry for

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Elizabeth A., and I’m here because I have been feeling depressed lately."
He nods, and looks concerned, "Tell me more about this depression."
So I start talking, "Well, I've always had trouble focusing on things, but now it feels worse than ever before. It started after I graduated college. Now I can barely focus on anything without being distracted by something else. My mind just goes blank. I don't know if it's related, or not, but I feel less motivated than I used to.   And then there's the sex drive..."
Dr. Szozas smiles, and gestures for me to continue. I do, "I guess that would be the biggest change. When I was younger, I didn't really care about the guys I dated. But now I want them all the time. I crave their touch, and I need to get off so bad. And I need to keep doing it, I need to cum so hard, I need to cum again, and I need to cum one last time. I'm a mess. I need help. I need a prescription for a real life-changer!"
I smile, and I think I blush, and I realize I am really babbling. "I hope I haven't made a fool out of myself, I apologize if I did. I just need help. I'm a wreck. I need a pill. I need a solution!" I say, and I reach into my purse for my phone, which I turn on, "I'll send you a picture, if you'd like to see what I look like when I'm horny!" I giggle, "I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that. You probably wouldn't find it attractive, I'm sure!"
I try to laugh, and I fail, "I'm sorry I embarrassed you!" I say, "But seriously though, I really

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Anna Marie Johnson, I live in Brooklyn, New York."
He nods, "And what brings you to our little clinic?"   My face gets hot, and I stammer, "I don’t know what happened. It just started happening one day.   My mom said she had heard about this place called 'Psychology Today,' and I thought maybe I should check it out, because I was feeling really weird. And then I saw an article online by a guy named Mark Twain, and that got me thinking. Then I went onto the web, and found out there was actually a doctor named Michael Szozas, who specialized in unusual cases, which is exactly what I have been dealing with for the past few months. I emailed him, and we arranged for a meeting, and I came all the way out here to meet him. I hope I did the right thing, I feel like I've made a terrible mistake. I'm scared and confused, and I need help!"
Dr. Szozas looks at me, and I can tell he is evaluating my emotional state. He asks, "Have you ever experienced any sexual abuse? Physical or psychological trauma, or a loss of a loved one, or anything else traumatic or life changing?"
I shake my head, "No, I think I'm fine. I haven't done much in the way of sex, I guess I am a virgin, and I've never dated anyone or gone on a date. I do masturbate sometimes, but I try to keep my thoughts away from things like that. I also read a lot of erotica, I enjoy watching porn, I like reading stories, I watch a fair amount of television, and I listen to music."
Dr. Szozas sits back, "Do you drink alcohol or use drugs, including marijuana?"
I nod, "I smoke weed, a couple times a week. I'm not sure if

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Anna Maria." And then I pause for a moment, thinking about what else to say, and then I continue, "And I came because I want to know what's happening to me."
He nods his head slowly, waiting for more information, but I don't have any other details to add. It occurs to me that perhaps this is a bad idea; I've never met anyone before who can tell me exactly what's wrong with me. But I feel compelled to go forward, to try something new. Maybe I'll find answers to all of my questions at once? That sounds like a good deal.
"Anna Maria, I'd like to start by asking if there is anything that you would consider unusual or abnormal in your life?" he asks.
I think for a second, and I realize that I'm not sure what is normal for a woman my age. I just graduated high school a few months ago, and I haven't been on a date in a while; I suppose I should get back out into the world. I decide to give him a partial answer; I guess I can share a little about myself without revealing too much. "Well, I was a straight-A student in high school, and I got a scholarship for college. I wanted to major in psychology, and I was planning on attending a university in the Midwest. My parents were against my plans, though, and they insisted I attend a local community college instead. They said I was wasting my time, and I wasn't going to amount to anything. I didn't listen to them, and I went ahead and applied for the scholarship anyway. I was accepted, and I am now in my last year at the University. I work part-time at a fast food place, and I live in a dorm. I spend most of my free time alone, reading books, writing in my journal, and trying to figure out how to change my family's mind about

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Elizabeth Rose." I feel embarrassed to say this, but I don't want to give any other reason than what I've given him. It just feels wrong to hide anything else about myself.
He nods, "Good, good. Now tell me what brings you here today?"   My face burns hot under his gaze, and I begin speaking, "I have been having problems since...well...since I was born. My parents were never married, and they split up before I was even conceived. They didn't know each other very long, and then one day my mom said she met somebody else, and left. She moved away, leaving my dad. He wasn't really happy about that. 
So I grew up without a father, but not knowing where my mother went, or if she was still alive. I had two brothers, but I never knew them, either. I guess my mother felt guilty, because I found out years later that my mother died when I was only eight months old. I didn't find out until I got older, and I couldn't remember her at all. I had no memories of my childhood, and I thought I'd lost my family forever when my mother disappeared. I can't explain it exactly, but I think I might be a psychic, or something similar to a psychic. I sense things sometimes, and I get flashes of knowledge, like a memory. I'm afraid I may be a danger to others, or a threat, and I need help. I haven’t told anyone yet, and I'm hoping you can understand my fears, and maybe help me figure out if I should go public. I would hate for people to think I'm crazy, and I'm worried I'll hurt someone.
I'm sorry, I'm rambling. I'm a bit nervous talking to you." I stop, and I wait for his reply.
Dr. Szozas is quiet for a moment,

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Stephanie, and I'm 21 years old."
He looks back at me, his smile broadening, "And what brings you here today?"
I blush, "Well, I've been experiencing certain things lately that have left me feeling very confused about myself."
"What sort of 'things', exactly? Do you want to tell me what happened, or do you just need advice?"
"I guess I'll start by telling you that I have recently become sexually attracted to men, specifically older men."
"That sounds quite interesting. What age range are we talking about?"
"I would say anywhere between 40-60, but mostly in the 50s and 60s. I think they're more attractive than younger guys, too."
"Why is this happening now? Did something happen recently that caused you to feel this way?"
"I don't know if I can put it into words. I always thought I was straight, until I started getting feelings for a few different boys a couple months ago. And then I realized I was interested in them, and I didn't care if I was gay or not. I was still attracted to their bodies, and I wanted to touch them. I liked the idea of being close to another guy, even if I wasn't really into the sex part. But I never felt that way before. I was thinking that maybe I was bi, or I was curious, but I couldn't explain to anyone else. I tried to find out if I was actually bisexual, and I read up on it online, and I was pretty sure I was. So I came to the conclusion that I was probably a closeted lesbian."
Dr. Szozas nods, "I see. That's a lot to process all at once, isn’t it? It must be hard to deal with that much change in such a short amount of time. You should give

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Alice White."
He nods thoughtfully, and asks, "And what brings you here today?"
I pause again, and then say, "Well, I've been having some problems lately..."
Dr. Szozas responds, "That's good news, don't worry about it too much, we can get through this together, alright? Tell me what happened."
So I tell him, and he listens intently, nodding along as I talk. When I finish talking, he turns away for a moment, and appears to think deeply before responding. Finally, after what feels like an eternity, he looks back at me. "Alright, let's start by getting a few things straight. First off, I want to know if there is any possibility that you are being blackmailed. If the answer is yes, please continue telling me everything. Do not leave anything out, ok?"
I nod, and I proceed to tell him everything that I have discussed thus far with Sherlock Holmes. I feel somewhat relieved when I finally conclude the story, and I find myself smiling at the memory of the conversation I had with Mr. Holmes. I am just finishing up when the doctor speaks up. "Good, now I would like to ask you a couple questions. I will not lie to you, and I won’t judge you either. I promise. Please, go ahead. What do you wish to discuss, and what is on your mind?"
I close my eyes and breathe slowly for a moment, and I open my eyes to speak, "Ok, well, I was wondering if I should be seeing a counselor because I'm feeling a little depressed, but I also have a lot of anxiety. I'm not sure which one is worse, or maybe they are both bad at the same time."
Dr. Szozas smiles and replies, "Excellent! Let's begin with the depression. You seem to

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Robert James Renshaw." I feel my face flush slightly as I speak. My mind flashes back to the image of myself in my apartment, masturbating while thinking about this very same man. The more I think about him, the hotter I get, and I have to fight the urge to touch myself. I clear my throat, "Uh, thank you for seeing me today, Dr. Szozas. I've been having problems, uhm...   I don't know if they're issues, but I just need help figuring them out. They seem to be getting worse lately. It started after I got engaged. I was really happy to find a girl that liked me, and we were planning our wedding right away. But then she broke up with me. She said I wasn’t enough for her, and I didn’t understand what I did wrong. I tried to talk to her, to figure out what I did wrong, but I couldn’t do anything to change the way things ended. I went to a therapist, and I thought maybe I should go on antidepressants, but I realized I had a problem with sex. I can't control my urges. And I want to, I try, and I fail. I'm not sure what to do. I'm embarrassed to say it, but I'm attracted to men, and I'm not sure why I'm doing this to myself. I'm not sure what to do. I'm a virgin, and I'm afraid I'll never experience the pleasure of a woman. I'm not even sure I'd know how. I'm scared, and I'm ashamed. I'm sorry for being a pervert, and I apologize for my behavior. I just need to know what I'm dealing with, and I don't know where else to turn. I'm hoping I can trust you, and I hope I can work through my issues, and I'm willing to follow whatever
