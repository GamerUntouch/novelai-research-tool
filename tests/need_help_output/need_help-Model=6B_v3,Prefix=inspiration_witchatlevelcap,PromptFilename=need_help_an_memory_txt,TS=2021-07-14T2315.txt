=== Prompt ========================================
I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
[Period: Modern Day]
[Year: 2020 AD]
[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "


=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Falfa Shouma."   I don't know why, but I feel compelled to give him my real name, even though I've never met this person before today... It feels right. And then I add, "And I came because I want to get help with something..." 
He responds, "Your parents must have been very proud to produce such a lovely daughter. You're quite beautiful, aren't you?"
I blush, but I smile back at him. "Thank you. Yes, they were very happy about being able to provide for me." I say, and I can tell by the way he looks at me that he thinks that I am lying, or maybe I'm making fun of him. But I keep talking, "I guess there are a lot of things I need to work on..."
"Yes? What sort of problems do you think you may have?"
"Well..." I begin, and I start thinking about all the issues I had growing up, and I realize I need to talk about them one at a time. I try to figure out which ones to bring up first.
First off, I should probably mention my lack of a sense of direction. I couldn't find my way to the bathroom, and I always got lost in the mall. I also didn't really understand the concept of money, and I would steal from my family and friends, and I was pretty bad at schoolwork. I wasn't good at math, and I struggled with language arts. I was a little bit better at science than history, and I didn't excel in music. I was terrible at sports. I was a total failure at everything.
I thought I might be a bit strange, and I was worried I might not fit in anywhere.
Dr. Szozas listens intently as I speak, and he nods along when appropriate. He asks questions to clarify my points and offer suggestions for improvement. For example

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Falfa Beldia. My mother died when I was young, and she left me this house. It was inherited by her husband, but they were separated, and then he passed away without leaving any children."
Dr. Szozas nods, and asks, "How long ago did that happen?"
I answer, "It happened about ten years ago now. I was still a child at the time, and I didn't know what had occurred. But I can remember being alone in the house. The windows were open because it was summertime, but there wasn't anyone else living there."
Dr. Szozas responds, "That sounds like a very difficult situation. What do you think triggered the change in your life? Was it a traumatic event?"
I nod, "Yes, I believe so. I don't really want to talk about it too much... I'd rather just get help..."
He smiles at my hesitation, "Of course, if you're uncomfortable talking about it, I'll respect that. I'm not trying to pry into personal matters, I promise. I'm more interested in hearing about the specifics of the problem. I may not have the answers, but I will try my best to help you find them. Please, go ahead."
I take a deep breath, "I've been seeing a counselor named Halkara, and she suggested I come to see you. She said I should come in for a consultation. So I came today, and I hope I'm not imposing on you. I'm sorry if I am, I really need help, I feel like I'm losing my mind, I don't understand myself anymore, I'm having trouble making decisions, and I'm scared that I'm going to lose my job. 
"I work at a restaurant, in the kitchen, and my boss is a woman named Lotte. I met her when we both worked in the same place

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Falfa Laverde."
He looks surprised by this, but then nods, and asks, "And what brings you to my office?"
I tell him about my relationship issues, and how they've been causing me trouble at work, and I feel depressed. I also talk about how I want to find a good boyfriend, but I can't seem to meet anyone interesting...
Dr. Szozas listens intently to all of my problems. When I finish talking, he sits back in his chair and sighs deeply. It makes me wonder if he's thinking something negative about me, but he shakes his head, "I think we should start there," he explains.
"You do?  What would you suggest?" I ask nervously, and he smiles at me reassuringly.
"Let's get started," he says.
I have a lot more questions, but I know that he wants to hear my story first, so I just listen quietly.
After I tell him what happened at the party, I continue to speak, "I had a hard time sleeping after the incident, and I was having a really rough day at work. I felt like I couldn't focus on anything, and I kept seeing that monster again and again in my mind. I was scared, and I didn't know what to do. I went to the restroom at the office, and I was crying in the stall. The sound of the toilet flushing helped calm me down a little bit.
"When I came out of the bathroom, I saw a young girl sitting on the bench outside the ladies room. She was wearing a long dress, and she looked really cute. I thought that maybe I could introduce myself to her, but I wasn't sure how to approach her.
"'Do you need a ride?' I asked.
"'No thanks,' she replied.
"I got the feeling that she was a little shy, and I decided

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Falfa."
He nods, and asks, "And what brings you here today?"
"Um... Well..." I begin, "It's about this really weird feeling I've been having lately, and I think it might be related to a problem I have..."
He gives me a smile, which makes me feel better, and then he replies, "So tell me what brought you here."
I start talking, and after a few minutes, I realize that I can talk freely without worrying about being judged. I don't even need to hold back anymore; I just blurt out whatever comes to mind, and I find myself telling him all about my life, including things that I never would have admitted to anyone else.
"This is very interesting," he murmurs, and I turn to look at him, surprised by his reaction. I'd thought that he was listening intently, but I didn't expect him to actually say something, or show any sort of emotion.   "Do you want to continue? If not, we'll stop right now. It is not necessary for us to go further than this point. I will do my best to help you get through this issue."
I'm stunned, and I reply, "Oh no, please keep going!"
He smiles again, "Then I shall proceed. First, I am going to ask you a question: Do you ever cry?"
"...No, I haven't cried since I was a child. But I used to cry a lot when I was little. My mom was always saying, 'Don't cry', and she scolded me for crying."
"I see. Then I suppose I should warn you, if you are going to cry, I won't judge you for it. In fact, I encourage you to let it out. I believe the more you express your emotions, the stronger you become. And the stronger you become, the less likely you

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Falfa Shalsha Laplace Sorelle Rondelia Laverde. I'm twelve years old, and I live in the village of Carillon."
He nods, and asks, "And why have you come today?"
I explain, "I've been having problems sleeping lately, and I can't seem to get back to sleep after waking up during the night.  My parents think it might be because I'm worried about my future, but I don't know what else it could be..."
Dr. Szozas listens quietly, nodding along. He looks at me, and then speaks. "What do you want to happen for the rest of your life? What would be best for you? And for us both?"
I pause, thinking. My mind goes blank, and I feel completely lost. I'd never even considered such things before.
"Um... I guess I just wanted to go on living, and keep doing the things I enjoy. I wanted to graduate high school, and attend college or university. I thought I could study art, or maybe something in fashion design. I had a dream to become a singer or an actress, or a dancer. I thought I could write a book, or start my own business. I loved reading, and I hoped I could continue writing, or perhaps work in publishing. I didn't care if I was a doctor or a lawyer, I just liked the idea of helping people. I wanted to travel, and explore the world. I was interested in science, and I thought I could help scientists find cures for diseases, or create new medicines. I wanted to meet interesting people, and experience different cultures. I wanted to marry a wonderful man, and have children. I wanted to grow older, and not lose my hair, and I wanted to keep my teeth for the next ten years. I wanted to remain healthy, and to avoid illness. I wanted to stay happy,

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Falfa Ruu Laverde." I pause briefly before continuing, "And this is Shalsha Ruu Lea Verlun." 
Dr. Szozas nods, and looks at both of us for a moment. It feels like we have been waiting forever for him to speak again, but eventually, he does. "So tell me about what brought you here today..."
We talk for a while, and I find myself enjoying our conversation immensely. He asks questions, and I answer them honestly. We laugh together, and it doesn't feel awkward at all. And then...
"It's time for you to go home now, Miss Falfa. You've had enough fun today."
Huh? What did I do wrong...? Is there something else I should say? I ask, "But... I wanted to hear more about my problems..."
He smiles at me, "I know, but I think you can figure those things out on your own. Your parents will be worried if you don't return home soon."
I stand up, feeling a little disappointed, and I walk out the door.
◇ ◇ ◇
I head back to the inn, thinking about the session I just had.
I didn't get the answers I was hoping for, but I learned a lot.
I was talking to a counselor, and I got a good impression of him.
I thought I was in trouble, but I wasn't.
I couldn't help but wonder if I was doing the right thing.
I was worried about my future, and I felt that I needed a professional opinion on my situation.
I want to try going to a therapist again.
I'm not sure if I'll be able to afford one, though.
I'm also wondering if I was too honest with Dr. Szozas; I probably shouldn't have told him everything.
I'm glad I came

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Falfa Laplace Shalsha, and I've been having trouble sleeping."
He nods gravely, "That makes sense... You were talking about insomnia earlier..."
Huh? Did I say something weird before coming in...? Oh yeah, I said, "I need help."
"So do we all, young lady. We'll get right to work. What would you like to talk about?"
What exactly does he want to know?
"Well, I'd really appreciate if you could tell me what 'insomnia' means. It sounds pretty serious, but I don't have any symptoms or anything. All I can think is that maybe I just need more sleep than other people. Is there a medical term for this, or should I ask my mom?"
"Hmm... Let's start by discussing the difference between normal and abnormal sleep patterns. Normal sleep is divided into four stages: NREM (Non-Rapid Eye Movement) Sleep, REM (Rapid Eye Movement) Sleep, and Wakefulness.   When a person is asleep, they move through those phases in order, never skipping a stage. This is the natural cycle for humans.
However, there are many different types of disorders that affect the way a person sleeps. Insomnia is one such disorder. 
In the case of a person suffering from insomnia, their body moves through the cycles in the wrong order. They might skip a stage, or go into a deeper phase of sleep without waking up.
This is called a Non-Restorative Sleep Disorder.
It's not the same as a lack of sleep. If a person is deprived of sleep, then they will still pass through the stages normally, in the proper order.
But when a person suffers from a Non-Restorative Sleep Disorder, the body is unable to wake up naturally after passing into the deep sleep stage, which is known as Hypnagogia.
Hypnagogia is

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Falfa Beelzebub."
He looks puzzled.
"It means 'Beelzebub, daughter of the devil.' It's just a nickname. My real name is Fa...Fafafa..."
Dr. Szozas smiles again.   "That's very cute. You have a beautiful smile. Do you want to tell me about what brought you here?"
I nod, and start talking.
"You know, I've always been pretty smart, but lately I feel different. Like I don't understand things anymore, or can't do them properly. When I try to talk, I get stuck on words, and I say weird stuff sometimes. But most importantly, I think too much, and I worry myself sick. That's why I came to see a doctor. I thought maybe I was crazy, but then I remembered I had a friend who went to this same place and she said they were really nice people there. They helped her, and now I wanted to come here, too. I hope I'm not crazy!"
Dr. Szozas listens intently to my story, nodding along. He doesn't interrupt, and I find that strangely comforting.
"And the symptoms are getting worse. I worry all the time. I'm afraid I'll never be able to go back home, and I'm worried about my family. I'm scared. I'm not sure if I'm even human. I'm a monster, aren't I? I'm a demon, right?!"
Dr. Szozas is silent. He just sits and thinks for a moment.
Then he speaks, "I suppose I should ask you a few questions, to determine if you're a monster, or not. I'd be lying if I told you that I didn't already suspect something. I have an idea of the sort of person you might be. What is your favorite food?
I answer without thinking, "

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Falfa Laverde."
He smiles, and nods, "And what brings you to our practice?"
I pause again, then continue, "Um...I don't know what this 'practice' is..."
"We provide counseling services for people who have unique problems they wish to discuss," he explains. "It can be anything from stress management to anxiety issues, or any other mental health problem. We also offer support groups for those who find themselves struggling with certain issues."
That sounds nice, but I wonder if there is a catch.  Then I think about the fact that we've just met, and maybe I should trust him more than I do. If nothing else, I feel a little better after having said my piece to him. He asked for my full name and reason for coming in, which means I'm safe. I guess I'll get to the bottom of things in due time.
"So, Ms. Laverde, tell us about your concerns. What is troubling you? Are you experiencing any difficulties in life right now?"
I swallow hard, and say, "I need help. I want to talk, I really need to talk to somebody. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, or what I'm supposed to be doing, and I'm not sure I even know how I got to where I am. I'm not sure I understand the world I live in. I don't know the rules, I'm not sure I'm allowed to speak up, I don't know my place, I'm worried I might lose my friends because I won't fit in..."
I stop talking, and I hear a sound, a tiny chirp, and I look up at Dr. Szozas, and he's smiling, "I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was scaring you. Please, continue. You are most welcome to express yourself freely in my office; I promise

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Falfa Laplace Shalsha."
He smiles at this, and asks, "What brings you here?"
It's hard to explain why I'm here, because I don't know what the problem is yet, but I try anyway, "I've been feeling weird lately..."
"Tell me more about that... Weirdness."
This is easy enough for me to talk about, so I continue, "I feel sort of disconnected, and confused, and not myself. I can't think clearly anymore."
Dr. Szozas looks at me thoughtfully, then he reaches into his pocket, pulls out a small bottle, and pours a clear liquid onto the back of his left index finger. He holds up his right index finger to show me, "Take a sniff, tell me if you smell anything.   If you do, I want you to hold out your left hand, and I will place a drop on the tip of your little finger."
I do as he instructs, and I inhale the scent of the liquid on his finger. It smells sweet, almost floral. I wait for a moment, and nothing happens. I repeat the process, and I still get the same result.
"That was a placebo.  I wanted to test whether or not the sense of well-being would actually affect the brain chemistry. I have a suspicion that the answer is yes. I want to run some tests on you, which is where we'll begin. I'd like to ask you a few questions, if that's all right. Do you mind?"
I shake my head, and say, "Go ahead."
I had no idea how long I was going to be there for, or even if I was ever coming out again. I hadn't heard a peep from the outside world, and I wondered if I were really in a doctor's office. I sat and waited, and waited some more,
