  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

The things that happened to me after being bitten by the spider. How I lost my job, and how I've been having nightmares ever since. They were always dark, sometimes they were even violent, but the worst part was that they never ended, and I'd wake up sweating.\r\nWhen I finished telling him all about it, I asked him if there was any way to reverse the effects.\r\n\"Oh yes, there are several ways, but none of them will be easy. You'll need to be committed to treatment, and I'm not sure whether or not this is something you should go through alone. But I believe you would benefit from seeing another professional.\"\r\nDr. Szozas gets up and looks at his calendar book. He pulls out a sheet with two names listed under today's date, one is mine, the other is that of a colleague named Robert Brown. I feel a little thrill when I see that. I ask him to confirm that the appointment is with Dr. Brown. \"Yes, that is correct, but I understand that Mr. Brown is unavailable?\"\r\n\"No, I just talked to him earlier today, and he said that he was free until 2pm.\"\r\nSo I am scheduled to meet with Dr. Brown at 1PM, which gives me time to shower and dress. I leave the office with a spring in my step. I walk along the street, and I find myself humming a tune that I don't recognize. I stop, and I think about the appointment with Dr. Brown; I am nervous about meeting him.",

What is happening to you right now is a memory replay, a re-experiencing of something that happened to you before. It's a very common occurrence, but I'll be happy to give you a prescription that might help. I'd suggest taking two tablets three times a day, with a glass of water. They are a mild sedative, but I believe that they will reduce the frequency of the memories. I would also recommend that you go to bed early",

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

It appears that you were abducted by aliens, and had some sort of telepathic experience, followed by a physical change. Your appearance has changed drastically since then. And there is something else...”\r\nNow it is my turn to interrupt him. “It's not just that, Mike. My life has completely turned upside down. In fact, if this isn't an alien abduction case, I don't know what is.\"\r\nMike nods sympathetically, \"Tell me more about it.\"\r\nAnd I tell him everything: the strange dreams, the feeling that I was being watched, the feelings of dread when I thought about leaving the house, even the fear that made me want to stay inside all the time. The moment I start talking, I feel better; I'm no longer alone, I'm sharing with another human being. I'm able to talk about the things that I couldn't share with anybody. I stop only when I run out of words. I'm breathing easier now that I've shared with somebody. I feel less afraid; I'm no longer alone.\r\nDr. Szozas listens intently, nodding his head occasionally.

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

Could he possibly believe me?\r\nDr. Szozas notices my hesitation, \"It's alright, Ms. Smith, just state your request or concern, and we'll work together to find a solution.
