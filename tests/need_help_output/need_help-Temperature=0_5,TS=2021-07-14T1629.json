  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

Thank you for seeing me.\"\n\"OK, fine,\" he responds, smiling broadly at me.\nA brief silence passes between us, and I feel awkward, uncomfortable, like I should do something. What? What can I possibly ask him? How would I even begin to explain myself?\nFinally, I decide to just blurt it out, without preface or explanation, \"Doctor, um, what exactly is wrong with me?\"\nDr. Szozas sits forward, leaning toward me, and he replies, \"Well, let's start by talking about how you came to be here today. Why did you contact me?\"\n\"Because I was feeling weird,\" I answer honestly, and I watch his face carefully to gauge his reaction.\n\"And who referred you to me?\"\n\"Um, I guess it was one of those online ads that popped up when I went searching through Google. It said that Dr. Szozas specializes in unusual cases. That's all I knew about him before I called. So, I thought maybe he might have an idea about what's going on with me.\"\nDr. Szozas nods at me, and then looks at his computer screen, typing, \"Hmm... Yes, yes indeed, that sounds about right. Do you mind if we talk about that first?\"\n\"Sure,\" I reply, and I wait patiently while Dr. Szozas types.

Have you tried any medications or supplements yet?\"\nI shake my head no again, but I don't know if that was the right answer to his question. He gives me another chance, \"What about bioidentical hormones? They are natural compounds that mimic the actions of human hormones, they are not synthetic chemicals, but rather, are made from plants or animal products that are extracted and purified by chemical means. Bioidenticals are not subject to FDA regulation, but there are a number of studies that indicate that they are effective and safe. Are you familiar with them?\"\nI nod yes, but I am not sure how much I trust Dr. Szozas' recommendation of these 'natural' hormones.

    " You're quite young, and it would probably help you achieve an appropriate balance between estrogen and progesterone levels, which may alleviate many of your symptoms.\"\n\"No, never!\" I exclaim,",
    " shaking my head vigorously. Hormones scare me.\nDr. Szozas continues, \"Well then, let's move onto other options, shall we? Have you tried any medications or supplements",
    " yet?\"\nI shake my head no again, but I don't know if that was the right answer to his question. He gives me another chance, \"What about bioidentical hormones? They",
    " are natural compounds that mimic the actions of human hormones, they are not synthetic chemicals, but rather, are made from plants or animal products that are extracted and purified by chemical means. Bioidenticals are",
    " not subject to FDA regulation, but there are a number of studies that indicate that they are effective and safe. Are you familiar with them?\"\nI nod yes, but I am not sure how much",
    " I trust Dr. Szozas' recommendation of these 'natural' hormones. After all, he is a psychiatrist, and that is how he makes his living, prescribing medication to patients.\n\""

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

It all happened just after sunset.\nHe listens intently, nodding along as I talk, occasionally asking questions, such as whether there was anything else unusual about this particular day? Or did something happen earlier that might have triggered what followed? But mostly listening. When I finish talking, he asks me if there are any other details I'd care to share, which I do, and then he asks me about my dreams, and how often I dream them. He tells me that sometimes people who experience traumatic events find themselves dreaming about those events again and again.\nWhen I ask him what he thinks my problem is, he smiles broadly, and he replies, \"You don't know?\" He laughs softly, shaking his head, and then he looks up at me, and he says, \"It's called Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), or Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD). You've suffered an extreme trauma, and now you are suffering from PTSD, RAD, or both. That would explain a lot about your behavior since the attack.\"\nI'm stunned; I hadn't even considered that possibility, but it makes perfect sense to me. So much so that I'm not sure that I believe him at first. But when I think back, I realize that his diagnosis is completely accurate. So I nod, and say, \"Yes, I suppose that explains things.

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

We need to get things straight before we can proceed.\"\n\"Oh...\" I say, \"Well, um, I don't really have anyplace else to go right now. My car broke down yesterday, and I've been sleeping under bridges since this morning.\"\n\"Hmmmmm...\" He ponders this, and then responds, \"That does sound serious. Can you tell me what happened to cause your vehicle to break down?\"\n\"No. It just died out of nowhere. And by 'died,' I mean exploded into flames while I was driving along the highway. That's all I remember until waking up in an alleyway. I guess I must have hit something because there were several broken bottles scattered about. I took shelter beneath a dumpster nearby, and when I came out, I saw that my car had burned to cinders.\"\nDr. Szozas nods thoughtfully, \"And how long ago did this happen?\"\n\"Um...about two hours ago. Maybe more.\"\n\"OK, good, that gives us time to start making plans. You'll need to come back tomorrow at 9am to continue our conversation. Is that alright with you?\"\n\"Yes sir, thank you!\" I reply enthusiastically. He grins at me, and I return his smile. He stands up, and I rise to follow suit. He extends his hand, and I clasp it firmly. He looks into my eyes, and I feel his gaze penetrating me, almost as if he is reading my thoughts. I am not sure whether I should be alarmed or flattered.\nWe shake hands, and I walk with him to his door. He opens",

Do you want to talk about how you feel right now?\"\nI nod, and say, \"Yes, please.\"\nDr. Szozas sits back in his chair, hands clasped together in front of his chest.
