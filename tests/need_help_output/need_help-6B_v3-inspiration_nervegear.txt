=== Prompt ========================================
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "

=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Asuna Yuuki."
He nods, "And why have you come today?"
This time I answer more confidently: "Because... because..." My mind goes blank, and I try again, "...because I want to know what's wrong with me."
"Ahh, yes, good question," he chuckles, and then continues, "Well, let's start by getting all the facts straight. How old are you now? What do you study at school?"
I give him an honest reply this time, "Twenty-one years old. I'm currently majoring in computer science at university, and I've been doing fine there until recently. But lately I feel like I can't get anything done anymore."
"Anything else?"
I nod, "Yeah. I haven't had any friends since last year, and I think it might be because I'm always working online. And I don't really enjoy playing games much anymore either, so I just play them whenever I have free time. I guess that means I never really left the house or went out anywhere."
Dr. Szozas smiles knowingly, "Hmmmmm... I'm going to need to run some tests before we go too far along with this, but I'd say that your symptoms are pretty typical for somebody with an internet addiction disorder. You seem to be very intelligent, which makes it even worse; I bet if I asked you to describe a game system to me right now, I wouldn't be able to understand a word you said. Your brain is being overwhelmed with information that it doesn't understand, and that is causing severe stress. It's not surprising that you've lost interest in socializing with other people, nor is it surprising that you don't find video gaming enjoyable. I'll be conducting a series of psychological evaluations to determine if you have a problem with your wiring, but I suspect that it is indeed a case of an Internet Addiction Disorder. In the meantime

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My full name is Asuna Yuuki."
He nods silently, then asks, "And why did you contact me?"
This question stumps me, because I don't really know what happened after the last time I logged off... It wasn't until just now that I realized there had been something wrong with me. But still, I have this nagging feeling that I should tell him more than just my name.
So I begin talking, telling him all about it: The strange dreams that started right after I began playing SAO, the bizarre behavior I displayed during the beta test, even the fact that I'd stopped using any of my equipment or items (except the ring), including the sword at my waist. When I finish speaking, I realize that I've hardly spoken at all.
Dr. Szozas listens intently to everything I say, nodding along as if I were explaining things perfectly clear to him. Finally he speaks up. "You seem quite upset by all of this, Miss Yuuki..."
"Call me Asu--" I start to protest, but he cuts me off with a wave of his hand.
"...Miss Yuuki, please call me Michael. And I apologize for the abruptness, but I need to ask you one very important question before we can proceed with our discussion. Do you remember anything about the events that led to the creation of Aincrad? Anything that might give us a hint about the cause of your condition?"
It's such a sudden change in subject that I almost miss the meaning behind the words. I think back to the moment when I first met the mysterious black-haired girl named Leafa -- the first person I'd ever met who didn't treat me like a total stranger. She was the first friend I made in the game.
A lot of people died since that day, but I never lost a single friend. Even though I was a solo player at the beginning, I eventually joined a

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Asuna Yuuki." I feel embarrassed, because there's nothing else I can say besides this, but then again, I don't know what other information I should give him.
"As in 'the Sword Princess'? I've heard about you..." The doctor nods, pleased by my answer. "That's very interesting... You have quite an extraordinary story. What do you think is causing your problems?"
I tell him all about the strange things that happened to me in the last few days: the dream where I died, the weird sensation while playing SAO, the blackouts during combat, the fact that I can only use one sword skill per day, and finally, the memories that came back to me after waking up from the coma.
Dr. Szozas listens intently throughout my entire tale, nodding his head occasionally. When I finish speaking, he looks up at me with those beautiful hazel eyes. "You mentioned that you were having memory issues, yes? Do you remember anything before the incident with the player killing?"
"...No, I don't recall any events prior to the death of Kibaou. However, I did experience a period of time when I couldn't move or speak properly, and I had a vague sense that something was wrong with me. I also felt that I was experiencing a sort of mental disconnection with the rest of the world. I thought that I was losing myself to the game..."
"What about the memories that returned to you afterward, the ones that you experienced in the hospital bed? Did they bring with them a sense of loss, a feeling that you'd lost something important?"
"Yes, I believe that's right. I was surprised to learn that I was able to regain some of the memories that I hadn't been aware of until now. It was like I was regaining an old friend that I didn't realize was missing..."
"So the memories that came back to you are

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is...is Asuna Yuuki."
He nods, then asks, "And what brings you here today?"
Oh boy, this part is hard. What do I say? This is such a big decision, but I have to tell him something. My mind goes blank, and all I can think of is my mom saying, "Don't go off half-cocked!" But what would she know? I feel a little better after thinking about it for a few seconds, and I begin, "Well..."
"...You don't want to talk about it?"
"Ahh...no, not really."
Dr. Szozas doesn't seem too surprised by that answer, but rather accepts it calmly. He smiles again, and leans back into the chair, crossing one leg over another knee. "So tell me about it. You've been having trouble sleeping lately, right?"
That makes sense to me. It started about a week ago, when I got up early to catch the sunrise outside my window. The sun was just starting to rise, painting the sky orange through the curtains, and I stared at it with awe until I drifted off to sleep. That night, I woke up twice during the night to check the time, and both times I found myself wide awake with no idea why I couldn't get back to sleep.
When I went online later that day, I discovered that a lot of other people were experiencing the same problem: the inability to drop off to sleep at an appropriate hour.
"Hmm...that sounds similar to insomnia to me. Have you considered taking an anti-depressant?"
"No way. I'm fine. I'm totally healthy."
"Is there anything else that might be causing the issue?"
"Uh, no, I don't think so. I'm still getting plenty of rest. I wake up feeling refreshed in the morning, I exercise regularly, I eat well, I'm

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Kirito...and I think something very bad might happen to me."
He smiles again, and leans forward slightly, elbows resting atop his knees. "Well then, let's get started."
And that was all there was to our session: Dr. Szozas asking questions and observing my responses, while I answered them honestly. My heart thumped against my chest as we talked. The doctor had asked about my family history, my childhood memories, my personal relationships, my dreams and fantasies, my hopes and fears...all things that would normally require a long conversation with friends or lovers before divulging such intimate information. But not with this psychiatrist. It felt more like a chat between two old friends than anything else. And yet, when I finished telling him about Asuna, my dark-haired friend whom I'd met online, I couldn't help but feel uneasy.
When I described her to him, he frowned deeply. "Hmm..."
Dr. Szozas leaned back in his chair and stared into space for a moment, saying nothing. Eventually he looked up at me, his face grave.
"Tell me about the time when she died."
"...?" I blinked, unsure what to say.
"You said that you were playing the game together. Tell me about the last day you spent with her, the one that ended with her death."
"Um...well, I don't really know where to start..."
I was suddenly struck by a wave of anxiety that made me want to run out the door. I wanted to tell the good doctor about the terrible thing that happened to me, but I didn't have the courage to do that. I was afraid that if I did, I wouldn't be able to stop talking. I was afraid that I would forget the whole story, and that I would never be able to go through with the meeting.
But I was also curious about the reason behind his request, and

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Asuna Yuuki."
He nods slowly, then asks, "And why did you send this email?"
Now I have to think fast. "Um...because I can't sleep..."
He looks surprised. "That sounds serious."
"It is. It started after the beta test ended, and I've been having nightmares ever since. They're bad enough that they keep waking me up during the day."
"Nightmares? What do you dream about?"
"There's a girl named Kirito...and she's being chased by something horrible...and there are other people too, but their faces are hidden, and they want her dead...or maybe they don't know what they really want yet..."
Dr. Szozas sits motionless, staring at me intently. The silence grows uncomfortable, but finally he speaks again. "How long have you had these dreams?"
"Ever since the end of the beta test. But I thought that was just stress-induced insomnia until yesterday."
"...Yesterday?" He tilts his head quizzically. "What happened yesterday?"
"Well, um..." I glance away awkwardly, trying to figure out where to start. Finally, I say, "Last night I got into an argument with Eugeo about the exam tomorrow, and I couldn't stop crying."
The doctor's eyebrows shoot up at that last part, but I continue without pause.
"So I went to the library to try to find a book about abnormal psychology or counseling or whatever, but I didn't even get to the third page before I fell asleep. When I woke up, I realized I'd slept through the entire morning, and I felt awful about missing breakfast. So I took a walk to the café across the street to buy a croissant and a coffee, and when I came back to the guild house to check the time, I saw that it was already lunchtime."
The doctor

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Asuna Yuuki."
He nods. "And why did you contact me?"
"Well..." My mind races. Should I tell this guy about my problems? What would happen if I do? Is there any reason not to? But then again...what if he thinks I'm crazy? Or worse yet, what if he doesn't believe me?! I don't want to scare him off by being too weird.
But before I can answer, he cuts right to the chase: "As far as I know, you haven't been diagnosed with anything wrong with your body or brain. Am I correct?"
"...Yes, sir."
"Then let us begin. First things first, please fill out this form. It will help me determine where we should start our discussion."
With that said, he reaches into his drawer, pulls out a tablet PC, and hands it to me. The screen is a touch device, and I feel myself getting excited when I realize that I'll be able to use one soon enough.
"So, Miss Yuuki, have you ever heard of 'dissociative identity disorder?'"
DID is a term used to describe people with multiple personalities within their own bodies, which often leads to violence and other dangerous behaviors.
"No, never."
"Hmm. Well, if I were to diagnose you with DID, I'd say that yours is the most severe case I've seen. You are aware that you are experiencing two distinct identities at the moment, yes?"
"Uh huh."
"Let me ask you something. When was the last time you had a dream that was different from the others?"
"What do you mean?"
"Do you remember the dreams that you experienced just a few nights ago? Before you woke up?"
"Oh yeah! I dreamed that I was a knight fighting a giant dragon!"
Dr. Szozas smiles broadly. "You were dreaming about

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Kirito."
He smiles again, and nods. "And what brings you here today?"
"...To talk about myself..."
"Yes? What do you want to talk about?"
Oh boy...this isn't going to go well, I think to myself. But I can't stop now. I need to know if there's any chance I might have Asperger syndrome or something. If I don't find out soon, I'll probably just keep wondering until I die. And I won't be able to face Eugeo anymore if I've got this wrong.
So I say, "Well...the reason I came to see you was because I found a doctor online named Michael Szozas. He said he specializes in unusual cases, and recommended I consult with him about what happened to me during SAO."
Dr. Szozas raises an eyebrow. "Ahh, yes. The incident where you were trapped in the game world by the mysterious 'Death Gun.' You wanted to ask about your memory loss, right?"
That's exactly it. I nod vigorously. "Yeah. It was about four months ago when I started having trouble remembering things. I thought maybe it was the stress of the job or the fact that I wasn't sleeping well, but then I remembered that I'd been forgetting stuff before that too. I figured I should see if anything had changed since the last time I went to the hospital, but I couldn't remember the name or address, or even if I'd gone to the hospital at all..."
It feels like I'm confessing everything to the priest at a Catholic church, but I can't help that. I'm desperate to get this out.
The psychiatrist leans back in his chair, folds his hands together, and stares at me intently. His lips move slightly, forming words. "...Let me begin with the basics. Tell me about the symptoms. When did they start occurring,

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Lisbeth Johansen."
He nods slowly, then continues, "And tell me, what brought you to this point?"
"Well..." My throat tightens, and I swallow hard before continuing, "...it all started last night...or rather, morning."
"Go ahead, please." He encourages, leaning forward slightly, elbows resting atop his knees.
So I begin, telling him about the dream I had, and about the strange sensation I felt while sleeping. "It was really weird. It wasn't just a normal feeling of sleepiness, but something else, almost like an itch or pressure deep inside my chest. I couldn't move, and I was afraid to open my eyes."
"Hmm...that sounds quite interesting indeed. What did you do next? Did you wake up?"
"Yes. But not right away. Instead, there was a noise outside the window, like footsteps. The door opened, and two men entered the room. They were dressed completely in black suits, and they carried guns. I tried to get up to run, but I was paralyzed. And when one of them turned his gun toward me, I woke up screaming."
Dr. Szozas sits silently for a moment, processing the information. When I don't say anything, he asks, "Did you feel any fear during the dream itself, or only afterwards?"
"Only after I woke up."
"Interesting. That is very common among people who have been through traumatic experiences such as rape, kidnapping, assault, etcetera. After the trauma occurs, the brain often blocks out the memory of the event until a later time. In the case of a nightmare, the experience is usually triggered by a subconscious link to the original incident. For example, if a person is raped, the rapist might appear in a dream, which is then linked to the actual perpetrator. This is called the 'flashback effect.'"
"Oh..."

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Asuna Yuuki." I pause briefly before continuing, "And I've been having trouble sleeping lately. It started two weeks ago..."
"Two weeks?"
"...Yes...It feels like I can sleep for maybe four hours at best, then wake up again and start feeling anxious or restless. When I do get to sleep, I have nightmares all night long. They're always about being trapped somewhere, and I feel like I'm suffocating. My breathing gets really fast and shallow, and I try desperately to escape, but I just can't move, even though there's nothing physically holding me back. And sometimes, I'll dream about falling off something high up, or getting lost in a forest where I don't know what direction to go. Or I might dream about running out of water, and dying. But those dreams aren't very common. The most common ones are the ones about being trapped in a dark room, with monsters coming after me. Those are the worst."
Dr. Szozas nods slowly to himself, "That sounds quite severe." He pauses momentarily, and then asks, "Do you think it would be possible to find out if this is due to a chemical imbalance? Perhaps we should run a blood test to check your levels of various hormones."
"Um...yes, I'd like that. Is that possible?"
He smiles gently at me, and I blush a little at the warmth. "Of course. I will need to order the tests myself, however; I'm not allowed to give medical advice without seeing the results first. I'm afraid that I may not be able to tell you anything until next week. I hope that isn't too inconvenient. Would you be willing to wait that long?"
"No problem! I'm happy to help!"
"Wonderful!" Dr. Szozas claps his hands together softly, and stands up. "Now, I believe that I mentioned that I specialize in
