He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",

It feels like there is a lot more happening than usual. And sometimes I get confused about things, or feel dizzy.   Sometimes I can't remember anything after waking up.\" I sigh, and shake my head, \"It's hard to explain.\"\nDr. Szozas nods, and looks thoughtful, \"Can you tell me what kinds of symptoms you experience?\"\nI try to summarize all the feelings and sensations that I have experienced, trying to put them into words. I begin by describing my headaches, which I say come on a regular basis, maybe once or twice a week. I also describe the strange feelings of disorientation I occasionally experience, and the confusion I feel when I wake up or go to sleep. I mention the occasional difficulty concentrating, or the loss of short-term memory, and the fact that I often forget names and faces. I speak of the feeling I sometimes have that I am not myself, and the way I sometimes become anxious and fearful.\nI conclude my summary, \"I don't know if this is normal, or not, but I think it is unusual. Sometimes I just want to cry and scream, or throw up or punch somebody.\" I stare at the floor, \"But I haven't done any of those things yet.\"\nHe smiles gently, \"Thank you for telling me your story; I appreciate hearing from people who are experiencing unusual symptoms. I will need to discuss the details with you in order to determine if we should schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have a phone number where I may contact you?\nI give him my cell phone number, and I ask for his email address, and I write out my home address on the back of an old business card.\n",

  "prompt": "I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",
  "result": "My name is Aqilah Alshayeb.\" I pause briefly, wondering if there is anything else I should say about myself? But then I continue, \"Aqilah means 'beautiful.'  I don't know what beautiful means, but I hope it fits me. I've always been pretty, and people have complimented me all my life. I guess this is part of the reason I want help, because I'm not sure if I am a beautiful person, or if I just think I am. It feels strange to describe my own self in such a way, but maybe I can do it by describing others, instead.\nI'll start with the best: my mother is a very attractive woman. She was born in the United States, and she married my father when they were both young, and moved to Saudi Arabia when my dad got a job offer. My mom is a nurse, and a school teacher, and my dad works at a small company in Riyadh. They live in a nice house, and we had a lot of nice things growing up, and I learned a lot of good values from my parents. I also learned a lot of bad ones from them.\nI hate my mother for marrying my dad, and for moving us away. I hated my dad for not being more protective, for not standing up for her when I started dating boys. I hated my dad for not trying harder to be a better husband and a better provider. I hate my dad for not loving my mother and making my childhood happier. I hate my dad for getting drunk and driving home, for failing to protect my mother and our family. I hate my dad for dying.\nI loved my mom, and I miss her. I wish my dad hadn't died. I feel sorry for my sister, who is only a year older than me, and I really love my little brother.
