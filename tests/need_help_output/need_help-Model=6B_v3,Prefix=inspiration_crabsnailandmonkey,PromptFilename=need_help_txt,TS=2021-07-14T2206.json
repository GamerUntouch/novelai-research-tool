  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

  "result": "My name is Araragi Senjogahara.\"\n\"And why did you contact me?\"\n\"Because...because...\"\n\"Yes? Because what?\"\n\"'Cause I want to know what's happening to me.\"\nSzizas nods slowly, then asks, \"What do you think is happening to you?\"\n\"Well, um, I don't really understand myself yet.\"\nHe laughs. It's not quite a laugh, more of a chuckle, but still very pleasant. \"You've got good instincts. You seem to have noticed something unusual about yourself already. That's the best place to start. What do you feel when you hear this word 'unusual'? Do you feel any sense of unease or anxiety? Or maybe excitement?\"\n\"...No.\"\n\"That's right. If you felt either one of those things, there'd be nothing strange about what happened to you. But if you didn't feel anything, then there would be plenty of reasons to worry about it. There are all kinds of phenomena we can experience in life, but the only ones that are truly abnormal are the ones where our bodies and minds react to them with fear or confusion. In other words, they leave us feeling uneasy, anxious, excited, confused, bewildered─or scared. And that's exactly the kind of phenomenon that you experienced today. Your body reacted to the sensation of being bitten by a vampire with a mixture of emotions: terror, disgust, confusion, even joy.\"\n\"Joy?\"\n\"Hm? Yes, that was the emotion that came up when you saw a bloodsucking creature. When I was younger, I was bitten by a dog while walking home from school. The pain was intense, and I couldn't stop crying, but I also felt a sense of relief that I wasn't going to die. I remember that vividly. I was relieved because I was safe, but I was sad that I had to go through",

Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.
