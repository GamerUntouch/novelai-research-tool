  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Irene Winters.\"\nHe nods, and then responds, \"And why are you here?\"\nAgain, I pause before answering, because I have never been asked this question by anyone other than myself. The truth is, I don't know why I came here. It just seemed right. I feel like something important will happen today, that there is a reason for me being here.\nSo I tell him, \"Because I want help.\"\nHe smiles, and replies, \"That sounds reasonable enough to me.\"\nNow I can relax, knowing that I'm not crazy after all, or insane. And I think back to what I saw on the web...\nI realize that I've gone blank again, and I try to focus, but I'm having trouble doing so. My mind wanders off to thoughts of a world where everyone is happy, and they live together in peace. I wonder if such a place exists, and if it does, would I ever want to go? Or perhaps I'd prefer the chaos that is now. Perhaps I'm not really sure which one I'd choose.\nDr. Szozas asks me a few questions about my family history, and about my childhood. He listens attentively to my answers, nodding along, occasionally asking clarifying questions. I talk about the fact that I was born with a rare genetic mutation that caused an abnormally high amount of adrenaline to be produced within my body. I describe the symptoms I experience when I get excited: heart palpitations, shortness of breath, rapid breathing, sweating, and nausea.\nHe writes a lot of notes, jotting things down, and I watch him scribble away, the pen scratching across paper. He looks up, \"Is that everything that's relevant to the case?\"\n\"Yes,\" I answer.\n\"Alright, let me summarize the situation,\" he begins, \"You are experiencing extreme emotional states when you are stressed out",

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

But then again, maybe everyone already knows all about me... Maybe there are people who have been watching me since before I even realized what was happening to me. And maybe it doesn't matter anymore. I want them to understand, I need their help.\nHe nods slowly, as if digesting my words. \"Why are you here?\"\n\"Because I can't control my thoughts any more. They won't stop. I've tried to ignore them, but they just keep coming back. I thought that if I talked to somebody about it, I might get better...\"\nDr. Szozas leans forward slightly, resting one elbow upon his knee, and nodding slowly, \"Tell me about those voices, please.\"\nSo I tell him about the voices in my head that tell me to do terrible things. About how they whisper lies and deceit into my ears, telling me to hurt others or kill myself. How I'm afraid to leave the house because I'll never be able to hear the voice ever again, and I will be lost forever. I explain to him about the dreams, too, the ones that come to me when I sleep. I describe the images that I see in my mind's eye when I close my eyes, the scenes that play out.\nWhen I finish talking, Dr. Szozas sits quietly, his expression unchanging. \"You say that the voices are very real, that they are convincing, that you are hearing them right now?\"\n\"Yes. I swear to God, I am!\" I reply.\n\"What about the dreams? Do you remember the dreams when you were a child, when you slept at night?\"\n\"Yes, I always had bad nightmares when I was a kid, I still dream about the same",

So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him.

One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.

They're always different, but there's one common thread: people dying horrible deaths. I don't know what to think anymore. I'm afraid to sleep, because I fear waking up in another nightmare. My friends keep telling me I'm being silly, but I can't help myself...\"\nDr. Szozas nods slowly, \"Yes, I understand completely. You have had a traumatic experience that was triggered by the book. That makes sense, given your history. I'm not sure if this will work out the way we hope, but let's try anyway. What exactly happened when you were reading The Book of Life? How long ago was that incident?\"\nI recount the events of the night before last, thinking about how I got home, and how I opened the door to our apartment building. I close my eyes, reliving that moment, feeling the coldness of the air, hearing the wind blowing through the trees outside the window. \"It feels like only yesterday. But it was really early morning. I woke up just after sunrise; I remember that much. I went to bed at midnight, and I fell asleep instantly. When I woke up, I knew something terrible must have happened while I slept. I didn't want to go downstairs to check the news, but I felt compelled to do so. I made it to the elevator, and I pressed the button to call it. I kept waiting, but nothing happened.

And I don't know what else to do.\"\nDr. Szozas smiles kindly at me, \"Have you ever felt better when you were asleep?\"\n\"No, not really. I guess sometimes I get sleepy when I try to rest, but it doesn't usually help.\"\n\"Do you remember anything before waking up today?\"\n\"Nothing really... except that I was reading through the sites on the internet, and I got tired of it. I wanted to go outside, but I couldn't find my shoes...\"\n\"You didn't wake up with any memory gaps, did you?\"\n\"Memory gap? No, nothing like that.\"\n\"So the only thing that you recall is that you woke up, and that you had trouble sleeping at night until recently. Is that correct?\"\n\"Yes, that's right.\"\n\"Well, I'm going to start by asking you a few questions, and we'll work our way backwards from there. Are you familiar with hypnosis?\"\n\"Uh, no, I'm afraid I'm not. I don't understand the concept well at all. I'm sorry.\"\n\"That's OK, I'm used to people being unfamiliar with the idea. Do you mind if I ask you to close your eyes?\"\n",
