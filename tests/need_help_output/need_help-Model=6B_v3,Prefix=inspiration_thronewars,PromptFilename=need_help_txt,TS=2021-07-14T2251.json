So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him.

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is...   My name is...\" I can't remember, but then again, maybe I should just tell him. \"I don't know.\"\nHe nods, \"OK, let's start there. Why do you feel compelled to seek counseling?\"\nWell, I'm embarrassed to say this, but I have been masturbating while thinking about men since I was young. As far back as I can recall, I've always had this obsession with males. It started when I was little, with watching cartoons where the male characters were shown having sex. That led to playing with myself imagining being fucked by different guys, sometimes fantasizing about them becoming real. The fantasies became more intense over time until they took hold of my mind and would not leave.\nIt wasn't until high school that I realized what was happening, and I tried to get rid of it. I'd try to think about other things, but nothing seemed to work. Even when I was asleep, the images kept coming up in my dreams, and I couldn't escape them.\nSo one day, after trying to ignore the problem for a long period of time, I decided that something drastic needed to be done. I went out and bought a vibrator, which helped a lot. But still, the thoughts wouldn't go away.\nAnd now I find myself unable to stop myself from constantly thinking about fucking men. I'm afraid that if I continue without help, I'll end up hurting somebody, or worse yet, killing myself. I'm very worried that I might be sick.\nDr. Szozas responds with a sympathetic smile, \"Oh dear, I'm sorry to hear that. I'm going to ask that you refrain from discussing the specifics of your sexual desires with me. I'm sure you understand that we must maintain strict confidentiality in regards to these matters.\"\n\"Yes, I'm aware of that,\" I reply, and I nod, \"I promise I won't discuss",

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is ... uh... ah...\"\nHe smiles encouragingly, \"That's fine.\"\n\"Ahhh ...\" I stutter again, because I don't know what else to say.\n\"What can I do for you?\" he asks, softly, patiently.\nIt feels like I have been waiting forever since I arrived. The silence stretches uncomfortably long, and finally I speak up, \"You said you specialize in unusual cases? What does that entail?\"\nDr. Szozas looks at me intently, \"Well, let's start by talking about your symptoms. How old are you?\"\n\"Twenty-three,\" I answer promptly.\n\"Have you ever experienced any significant traumas or events in your life?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"How often did you masturbate last week?\"\n\"Every day.\"\n\"And before that?\"\n\"A couple times a month.\"\n\"Did you ejaculate during those sessions?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Do you remember if there was anything different about the way you felt afterwards?\"\nI think back to the night I had sex with Kaitlyn, which was an orgasmic experience. But I didn't cum after that either. I shook my head, \"no.\"\n\"What about when you were younger -- do you recall having any unusual experiences when you were a child, perhaps even when you were young enough to be considered a pre-adolescent?\"\n\"Um, no. I don't really remember much about when I was little.\"\n\"Are you sexually active with anyone right now, are you currently involved with a partner, girlfriend, boyfriend, wife, husband, are you single, are you celibate, are you monogamous, are you bisexual, are you pansexual, are you polyamorous, are you promiscuous, are you non-monogamous?\"\nDr. Szozas keeps asking questions until I am exhausted from answering them.",

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

When I was 19, I had a boyfriend named Charlie. We dated for three months before I went off to college. It was great -- I loved being with him, and I really thought that maybe there was a chance that one day I'd marry him. But when I came back home for Christmas break, he dumped me. It hurt so much -- I cried all night long, and even though I tried to convince myself that it would get easier with time, nothing changed. And now, well, I don't know if I'll ever find anyone to love me again...\"\nDr. Szozas' smile is gentle and understanding; I sense that he is thinking deeply about my situation. He asks, \"Have you talked about this with a therapist or a friend? How did they react to the breakup?\"\n\"No,\" I admit, \"because I didn't want to hear their opinions. I wanted to do the dumping; I couldn't stand to have them tell me that I needed to try harder or that I shouldn't be such a crybaby. I'm not sure if I'm a 'crybaby', but I guess I am.\"\nDr. Szozas chuckles softly at that; I look up at him with a quizzical expression",
