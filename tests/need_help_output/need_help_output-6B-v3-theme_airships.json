  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.

Did he say anything specific to cause such a reaction in you?\"\n\"No, nothing specific. Just that we were breaking up because things weren't working out between us anymore. That's not true though. We just had different ideas about where our relationship was going to go next. I wanted more commitment than he was willing to give, and vice versa. The break up wasn't caused by any one thing; it's a culmination of many little events that added together to create the final result. He said I didn't want to grow with him. Well, I do! I've been with him almost a year, and I want to keep growing with him. I think that he wants to stay stagnant. I'm sorry if I offended him somehow, but I am trying to move forward, and I need help doing that.\"\nDr. Szozas sighs, \"So, let me ask again: What brought you to me today?\"\n\"I have no idea. I'm usually pretty good at figuring out stuff like that, but I guess I got distracted. I went to the web site to find a psychiatrist, and I found yours. I'm hoping that I can get some insight into what I'm feeling.\"\nDr. Szozas smiles, \"You must be a very smart girl to figure",

The other is the inability to sleep. Most patients with major depressive disorders are unable to get a good night's rest. Yet you are able to sleep just fine. That is also inconsistent with a diagnosis of depression, unless the insomnia is caused by the depression itself. I find that highly unlikely. I believe that your sleep problems are more likely due to a medical issue that is unrelated to the cause of the depression.\"\nI'm confused, \"What does that mean?\"\n\"Have you ever suffered from a common cold before now?

    "'t it? You should talk to your doctor about that. But let me tell you about myself first. My name is Michael Szozas, MD. I'm a psychiatrist, specializing in unusual cases",
    ". I work mostly with people who suffer from severe mental illness. In fact, I would consider your condition to be quite unique.\"\nThis surprises me, \"How can that be?\" I ask.",
    "\nDr. Szozas smiles, \"It's because your symptoms are not consistent with any known psychiatric disorder. For example, most sufferers of depression experience suicidal ideation or attempts, which are",
    " absent in your case. Also, they usually feel hopeless about their situation, while you seem to be optimistic about things.\"\nI frown, \"But I'm depressed!\"\n\"Yes, but that",
    " is only one aspect of your problem. The other is the inability to sleep. Most patients with major depressive disorders are unable to get a good night's rest. Yet you are able to sleep just fine",
    ". That is also inconsistent with a diagnosis of depression, unless the insomnia is caused by the depression itself. I find that highly unlikely. I believe that your sleep problems are more likely due to a medical",
    " issue that is unrelated to the cause of the depression.\"\nI'm confused, \"What does that mean?\"\n\"Have you ever suffered from a common cold before now? Or perhaps a flu,"

One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.
