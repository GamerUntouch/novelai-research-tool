My name is Amy.  I'm here because I have a problem."
He sits back down again, and looks at me, "A problem?  What kind of problem?"
I explain, "I don't know what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. I've been feeling this weird energy since last night, and now I can't seem to get it under control. I feel like I'm being pulled away from myself, and I don't know what's happening. I think I might be losing my mind."
He listens intently, and then he asks, "Have you had any other problems recently?"
I shake my head, "No, nothing like this. It's just happened one time before, and I chalked it up to stress, but lately things have been getting worse. I start to feel like I'm being drawn somewhere, and I don't know where or why. I never felt this way before, and I didn't even know I was feeling this way until today."
He nods, "Do you ever feel like you're being pulled apart from everyone else?"
I nod, "Yes, sometimes. I used to go out with my friends, and we'd all hang out together, but lately I haven't been able to do that anymore. I always end up alone most of the time. I try to talk to people, but they only want to listen, not really say anything themselves. I find myself unable to communicate with them at all. Sometimes I'll ask them something, and they'll just stare at me blankly, not saying anything at all. And I wonder if there's something wrong with me, that I'm not communicating with anyone at all. I wish I could talk to someone about this, but no one will tell me what's wrong with me. They won't give me an answer, either; they just act like I'm making it up. I hate that

My name is Jessica, and I'm here because I have a very unique case."
He nods, and then asks, "Do you have any idea what this might be?"
I shake my head, "No, I don't know what it is, but I've been having these recurring nightmares lately, and I think they may be related to my condition."
He continues to study me, and I can tell by his expression that he doesn't believe me. He looks at me again, and we both wait for each other to continue.
"You said you were having these recurring nightmares? What do those dreams involve?"
Again, I hesitate, and say, "Well, they start off just like normal dreams, but then they get more vivid, and seem to be getting more and more disturbing. Sometimes they even scare me, and I wake up screaming."
He shakes his head, "That sounds like a pretty severe case of PTSD. I would suggest that you seek counseling right away, and let us help you deal with whatever trauma you are experiencing."
I nod, "Yes, I'd like that. I'll go ahead and schedule an appointment with you tomorrow morning at 9am."
He smiles, "Excellent. I will see you then." And he turns back to his computer screen, and I watch him type something into his keyboard.
After he finishes, he stands up, and he walks to me, and he puts his hands on my shoulders, and he leans down and kisses me softly on the cheek. He whispers, "Thank you for coming in today. I hope that helps answer some of your questions."
I stand there, smiling, and he pulls me into his arms, and he kisses me again, and I feel his warm breath on my lips. He holds me tight, and I feel safe and protected in his arms. We kiss deeply, and I feel his hands caressing my ass, and I moan into his mouth

My name is Bethany, and I'm here because I think I'm schizophrenic."
He nods, "Yes, I can see that. You don't seem like any normal person. Are you sure?"
I nod again, "Yes, I'm sure. I have this feeling that I'm not myself, and I've been having these strange hallucinations lately. I know they aren't real, but I can't shake them off. They won't go away unless I do something about them."
He looks at me, "Have you ever been hospitalized before?"
I shake my head, "No, never. I haven't even been married long enough to have children yet. I'm just a single woman living alone right now."
He nods, "That makes sense. In fact, there's another reason we're here today. We need to run some tests to find out what's going on with you. Can you tell me more about those hallucinations?"
I begin to tell him about the dreams, and the strange things that have been happening to me, but he cuts me off, "Let's start with the ones that are most recent. When did you first start having these delusions?"
I pause, "Last week sometime. I was doing laundry, and I had a dream that someone was watching me while I was folding clothes. It scared me, and I woke up screaming. I didn't want to talk to anyone about it, but I couldn't stop thinking about it. I tried to forget about it, but it kept coming back to me. I knew I shouldn't be afraid, but I was. I decided to call my husband, but he wasn't home. I went to bed, and all night long I'd be plagued by these terrible nightmares. I finally got up the next morning, and took a shower, but nothing seemed to work. I felt so awful, and I really wanted to die. I called my doctor, but

My name is Peter, and I'm here because I've been feeling very unwell."
He nods, "OK, Peter, let's start by asking you some questions. What brings you to our office today?"
I think back to my last visit to the doctor's office, and I remember how he had looked at me then, and how he had seemed to know exactly what was going on with me. This time, however, there is no recognition whatsoever. Instead, he just asks another question, "What do you normally do for fun? Do you have any hobbies?"
I shake my head, "I don't really have any friends outside of work anymore. I used to go out with some friends once in a while, but they stopped coming after I broke up with them."
He nods, "Well, we can always try to find other people to hang out with, right?"
I nod, "Yeah, I guess so."
He continues, "So, what makes you feel this way?"
I sigh, "I don't know. It's like something inside me just snapped, and I can't get it under control again."
He nods, "And where did this snap occur?"
I consider telling him about the dreams, but I decide against it. The dreams are still too fresh in my mind, and I'd rather not risk getting caught up in whatever it is that's happening to me. Besides, I'm not sure I want to talk about it yet.
Instead, I tell him, "I was walking down the street one day, and I saw this girl, and she was crying. She said she was being chased by a monster, and that if anyone ever found her, they would die. I thought I should help her, so I ran away from her, but when I got far enough away, I started to hear this weird noise, like a roaring wind, and I couldn't stop it. I

My name is Ashley. I'm here because I have a problem."
He smiles again, and sits back in his chair, "So do I.  What can I do for you?"
I explain further, "I've been having sex with my boyfriend, and we've been doing it since high school. We've never had any problems, but lately our sex life has become more intense. It's almost like we're having an affair now. I don't know if this is normal or not, but I thought I should talk to someone about it."
He nods, "That sounds like a good idea.  How long have you been having sex with him?"
"Since we were 18 years old. We've been together for four years now."
He nods, "And what does your boyfriend say about all this?"
"He doesn't seem to mind. He just wants to keep doing it. He even said that he likes it when I orgasm during intercourse."
He nods, "Do you think there's something wrong with either of them?"
I shake my head, "No, I don't think so. They both seemed happy enough before they started having sex with me. But recently things have gotten weird. They used to be able to get off without me joining in, but lately they want me to join in too. This morning, they woke me up by making me masturbate while they did it. And then last night, they tried to convince me to suck their cocks after they finished fucking me."
He nods, "Sounds like they may be having an affair."
I nod, "Yeah, that's what I think. I feel like I'm being used, and I don't like it. I'm not sure if I should tell my boyfriend or not, but I'd rather not go through this alone."
He nods, "OK, I'll give you one week to decide. If you decide to

My name is Kayla Marie Wilson, and I'm here because I have a problem."
He nods, and then he asks, "What kind of problem?"
I pause, and think, and then I begin to tell him about the last few days, and how I've been feeling. I describe the feelings I get when I masturbate, and how I can't seem to stop myself. I explain how I feel like I'm losing control, and I start to cry.
Dr. Szolas reaches out and takes my hands in his again, and he brings them up to his face and looks at them intently. He rubs them between his thumb and forefinger, and then he smiles, "Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry. I didn't know what to do... What did you say your problem was?"
I nod, and I continue, "It's hard to explain, but I just started feeling like this..."
Dr. Szobos continues to hold my hands in his, and he tells me, "You don't have to worry about anything. You're not alone. We all go through this at one time or another. It's part of life. The important thing is to talk to someone about it, and let us help you work through it." He pauses, and then he adds, "We can't cure you, but we can help you deal with it. Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it."
I smile, and I thank him, and I promise to call him if I ever need any more advice.
As I finish telling him everything, he gives me a big smile, and he says, "Well, I'll be happy to give you some advice, but I really wish you'd come in sooner. I would have done something different with you earlier, but now that I know you're serious, I want to help you."
I blush, and I stammer

My name is Jennifer, and I'm here because I think I may have a case of OCD."
He looks at me again, and smiles, "Oh, I see... You've been through a lot, haven't you?"
I nod, "Yes, I guess I have..."
He continues, "You don't seem to be very happy right now, do you?"
I shake my head, "No, I'm not really happy at all. I feel like I'm going crazy."
He nods, "That's understandable. It's normal to feel this way when you start thinking about things that aren't normal. You'll probably feel better after we get started."
I nod, "OK then, let's get started."
He tells me to lay back on the couch, and he sits next to me, taking my hand in his once again. He strokes mine, and I close my eyes, trying to relax myself.
Dr. Szozo begins by asking me what brought me to him today, "Well, I was wondering if you would be willing to help me with something."
I open my eyes, and look at him, "What is it?"
He sighs, "It's a little embarrassing, but I need to ask you about your past."
I freeze up, "My past?"
He nods, "Yes, well, there are some things that I'd like to know more about before I can treat you properly. I want to run some tests, and I'd like to find out whether or not you have any issues that might be causing you to feel this way."
I look at him, confused, "Why would I have issues? What kind of issues?"
He pauses, "I'm not sure exactly how to say this, but I believe that you have some issues with authority figures, and I suspect that they are causing you problems."
I blink, "What do you mean?"

My name is Rosemary Jones, and I'm here because I have a problem."
He nods, "OK, let's hear it."
I begin by telling him about the problem, "I've been having this recurring dream where I'm in a room somewhere, and there's a man standing right next to me, and he's holding something very heavy, and he's trying to lift it off the ground, but it keeps falling back down again. It's hard to describe exactly what it looks like, but basically it's sort of like a big stone, or maybe a boulder?"
He nods, "So far, so good. But tell me more about the dream? What does the man look like?"
I don't know how to describe him, so I just tell him, "He's tall, and he has blond hair, and he's wearing a white lab coat, and he's really nice looking, and he's got this sweet smile..."
Dr. Szozoas interrupts me, "You're describing the patient, not the doctor. The patient is a man named Mark, and he's our patient. You'll get to know him better later today, but for now, please focus on the patient."
I nod, and I continue, "But then suddenly, he's gone, and I'm alone in the room with the object that he was trying to lift up... And when I ask him what happened, he tells me that he had to go to the bathroom, and that he didn't want to wake up my parents, so he left without me. I feel really sad about that, but I also feel relieved that he was able to go to the bathroom before he woke up my parents. He leaves his phone number, and I think that he'll call me when he gets home tonight. He's such a nice guy, and I hope that he calls me soon."
Dr. Szozas is nodding along, "That

My name is Robert."
He nods, "Robert?  That's a nice name.  You don't have any family, do you?"
I shake my head, "No, none whatsoever."
He looks at me, "Have you ever had a job before?"
I shake my head, "No, nothing like this."
He leans back in his chair, "What brought all this on?"
I think about it, "I guess I've been having trouble concentrating lately, and I haven't been able to concentrate very well since I started college. I also keep getting really bad headaches, and they get worse whenever I try to study."
He nods, "And what type of problems did you have while you were in school?"
I pause, then answer, "I got into some trouble during my junior year, and I didn't graduate because of it."
He nods, "So tell me about those troubles. Were there any particular incidents that led up to them?"
I think about it, trying to recall exactly what happened, "Well, I was partying pretty hard last summer, and I ended up getting into a lot of trouble. I ran away from home, and I wound up living with some friends in town. I just wasn't cut out for being an adult, and I couldn't handle it anymore. I tried to go back home, but they wouldn't let me in, and I'd gotten into more trouble than I thought possible. I decided to leave again, but I got caught by some guys who beat me up pretty badly. I spent three days in the hospital after that, and I came home to start over."
He nods, "How old are you now?"
I pause, thinking about it, "I turned eighteen two months ago."
He nods, "When did you first realize that you weren't happy with your life?"
I think about it, "I guess I realized it

My name is Sarah, and I'm here because I think I have a serious problem."
He nods, "OK, let's hear it then."
I open my mouth to speak, but I freeze. I don't know what to say. I can't even begin to describe this feeling. It's like being paralyzed by fear, all while wanting to scream, but unable to do anything. I feel like I'm going to faint.
Dr. Szozo looks at me, "Are you OK?"
I nod, "Yes, I'm fine. Just a little dizzy..."
He shakes his head, "No, nothing wrong with you. You're just a little nervous right now. Are you sure you're OK?"
I nod again, "Yes, I'm fine. I just need something to calm myself down."
He smiles, "Well, we can certainly try to help you with that. How would you like to start?"
I shake my head, "I don't know what to ask... What do you want me to ask?"
He thinks for a moment, "How did you get into this predicament? Do you have any history of mental illness?"
I pause, "No, I haven't had any problems with anyone before today."
He nods, "Good. Now, tell me about how you came to be here. Is there anyone else that you'd rather not talk about?"
I shake my head, "No, not really. I'm pretty much alone most of the time."
He nods, "That's good. We can work with that. Tell me about your situation: how long have you been having these problems?"
I pause, "Um, since last week, I think. I've been having these headaches, and I keep having these urges to masturbate, and I always end up doing it. I tried to stop, but I couldn't seem to control myself. I also
