My name is Mary Jane Watson." My parents were hippies, and they named me after one of their favorite heroes: Spiderman. When I turned 18, I took my last name back. It's just easier that way, plus my friends call me MJ. The doctor nods his head slowly, accepting this information. He leans forward slightly, his face serious now, "MJ, have you ever heard voices?"
He asks this question casually, without any sort of judgment or anger. But there is something else...he's waiting for an answer, or maybe he wants to hear more details? I think carefully before answering, trying to decide what would be best to tell him. He looks at me expectantly, but I don't know where to start. How do I explain being tormented by nightmares and waking up screaming? What if he doesn't believe me? I want to cry right then and there, because I'm not sure who I can trust anymore. I've never been good at telling people things that are difficult to say, and I feel myself getting upset again.
But Dr. Szozas continues patiently, "Mary Jane, please speak freely; we will discuss whatever issues come to mind, and I promise that anything said between us will remain confidential. We are here to help each other." He smiles reassuringly at me, and he relaxes into his chair. His hands rest comfortably atop his knees, and he gives me time to gather my thoughts.
What should I say? Should I mention the dreams, the night terrors? Maybe I should talk about my childhood? No, that might be too personal. So instead, I try to summarize my life, starting with high school and working backwards.
Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding his head when appropriate. His expression is calm, his voice even, but his eyes show his interest -- his concern.
I get lost in the story, talking about all the places I've lived

My name is Janelle Williams." I pause, thinking that this might seem odd coming from a woman who had been living alone in her home for months now...but maybe it doesn't matter?
He nods, waiting patiently. "And what brings you to see me?"
This time I answer more confidently, "It's just..." I trail off, not knowing quite how to explain myself.
"Just tell me what's troubling you," he urges gently, leaning forward slightly, elbows resting on his knees. His hands clasped together, thumbs rubbing against each other.
I begin to speak slowly, hesitantly, trying to find words to express all the things swirling inside my head. My heart rate increases as I speak, and I feel a tingling sensation across my scalp, as if an electric current were running through my body. It feels good though, very good. The room is quiet except for our voices, which echo softly throughout the space.
"Well, there are several issues, but let me start with something simple: How do you know that I can help you? You've never met me before today, have you?" He asks.
Again, I stutter, not having considered that possibility. I'm too busy being overwhelmed by his presence to consider anything else. "No, I haven't. But I saw a website about you, and I felt that I should contact you."
He smiles, amused, "Oh really, what was written about me, exactly?"
"Um, well, that you are a psychiatrist who specializes in unusual cases. That you are also a big movie buff, that you are married with two children, that you are a member of Mensa, that you are a fan of both Star Trek and Doctor Who, that you enjoy playing chess, that you are a writer, that you are a musician, that you are a cat person --"
Dr. Szozas chuckles, "Yes,

My name is Mary Smith, and..."
He cuts me off before I can finish: "Mary, please tell us what brought you here today."
I don't know where to begin, but then I realize that this guy knows what he's doing, and I relax a little.
"Well, uh... It started last night. I had trouble sleeping, and I couldn't get back to sleep after waking up once. And then I got up again. And then, um, I went downstairs, and I saw something strange there."
"What did you see?" asks Dr. Szozas.
"Um... A black shadow against the wall."
"And what happened next?"
"It disappeared."
"Did anything else happen? Any other details?"
"No. Nothing."
Dr. Szozas nods slightly, and smiles at me, "That's all right; we'll get more information later. Now, let's talk about your problem, shall we?"
"Oh, ok, well... My husband died six months ago, and I've been feeling weird since then."
"Do you have any idea what might be causing this?"
"Not really. There was nothing wrong with me prior to his death, and now I feel different than ever before."
"How do you mean 'different'?"
"Like, things seem to go by too fast. I find myself having thoughts that I didn't even think about yesterday, or sometimes not thinking about them at all. Also I just feel restless. Like I want to move but I'm not sure where to start. Sometimes I wake up and I'm not sure if I slept or woke up. Things are happening to me that aren't supposed to be happening to me."
Dr. Szozas leans forward, his hands clasped together, elbows resting on his knees, his face serious, "You mentioned that you were experiencing unusual feelings, and that you are

My name is Alice Johnson."
He nods, and asks, "And why did you decide to seek help?"
Oh boy, this feels uncomfortable. I don't want to talk about myself, but I know that I have to tell somebody. My mind races back to our first meeting, and I try to remember what happened then, but I can't seem to recall anything specific... Oh God, what if I've lost my memories? What if they're gone forever? No, please let them still exist somewhere inside my head.
I start talking: "Well, um..."
Dr. Szozas leans forward, and his face gets closer to mine, which makes me feel very vulnerable, "...you asked me earlier whether or not there was something wrong with me, and I said 'no'. But now I'm thinking maybe there is. You see, I started getting headaches recently, and I couldn't sleep properly because I kept having nightmares about being chased by monsters, and running away from them while trying to find help. And sometimes I would wake up feeling really hot, even though it wasn't particularly cold outside. Sometimes I'd be thirsty all day long, but when I drank water, it tasted horrible. It was just weird. Also, last week I got into an accident with my car, and I had to go to the hospital, where they took X-rays, but nothing seemed out of place. So, do you think I might be sick, Doctor? Am I dying, perhaps?"
Dr. Szozas smiles at me again -- those dimples! -- and shakes his head slowly. He looks at me with that warm smile, and his voice sounds kinder than usual, "Alice, I promise that I will answer any question that you may have -- but first, let's get one thing straight: I am not a doctor; I am a counselor. I am not a medical professional; I am a psychologist. If you are suffering from

My name is Angela Marie Morgan."
He nods, then looks back at me, waiting patiently.
"And I came because..." What do I say? How can I explain this without sounding insane?
"It's hard to know where to start...what would be helpful?" He asks, gently.
"Well, I've been having feelings lately that something isn't right. That there's more going on than just normal teenage angst and hormones. It feels almost like being trapped inside myself, but outside too, watching things unfold, and feeling them all at once. And now that I think about it, I feel like I have lost control of my body recently. Like I don't want to move, or speak, or even blink. And I'm worried that I may not be able to go home tonight." My voice cracks slightly, and tears begin to form in the corners of my eyes. I try to hold them back, but they spill out anyway, running down my cheeks and onto my lap.
Dr. Szozas gets up out of his chair, and walks around to kneel beside me, taking my hands in his own, and bringing them to his lips softly kissing each one. He brings my hands to rest against his chest, and places his other hand on top of mine. His warm breath caresses my knuckles.
"Angela, I understand that you are experiencing some unusual symptoms that are causing concern. I will get started by asking you questions, which should help us both better assess what we are dealing with. Please answer me truthfully, no matter how personal or embarrassing the question might be."
I nod, and he continues, "Do you feel that you are losing touch with reality? Do you feel that you are unable to tell friend from foe, or even stranger? Are you hearing voices, seeing visions, or receiving messages that seem to be coming from somewhere else, perhaps beyond our realm?"
"Yes! Yes!

My name is Lauren...Lauren Taylor." My heart is pounding as I speak, and I feel embarrassed, but I continue, "Well, actually my friends call me 'Lala'. It's short for Lola, because they used to tease me by calling me names like 'Lolly'."
He chuckles, then looks back at me, "And why did they do this?"
"Because..." I pause, unsure what to say next. Should I tell him? Will he think less of me if I don't reveal all of my secrets? Finally, I decide to go ahead and tell him. "...because I have really long hair, and they thought it was funny to pull at it while I walked past them. They would try to yank my ponytail off my head."
Dr. Szozas smiles, "So, those were the people who teased you about being called Lolly?"
"Yes, exactly."
"OK, now we need to talk about something else, something more important than teasing others about their appearance." He pauses, giving me time to get my thoughts together.
Finally, I ask, "What should we discuss?"
"How old are you?"
"Eighteen."
"Do you know where you live?"
"No, not at all. I've been living with my aunt since last year, after she took me in. She had no other relatives, so I guess that makes sense. I was never very good at making friends, so I didn't even realize that I was missing out on many things that most kids take for granted. I was just an introvert, and I spent my days holed up in my room reading books or watching TV. I was oblivious to much of anything that went on outside, until I got sick."
"Sick?"
"Yeah, well, I was diagnosed with leukemia. The doctors said that I wasn't going to survive, that I needed to

My name is Samantha Elizabeth Thompson." My heart is beating fast, and my palms feel sweaty. I try to slow myself down.
He nods slowly, and then asks, "And why do you think you're here?"
Oh shit, this guy knows exactly what's going on with me. "Well... I've been experiencing episodes where I can hear voices in my head, telling me things..." I say haltingly.
Szozas smiles again, his dimples flashing, "That sounds interesting." He looks away momentarily, trying to find the right words to use next.
"This all started about three weeks ago when I had a dream about an old woman, who spoke to me telepathically. She was saying terrible things about me. It scared me so much, because she seemed real, and her words were so vivid. When I woke up, I felt sick to my stomach, and I couldn't get back to sleep. So I got online, and found a site called 'Voices', which said they could help people deal with their mental problems. They told me to call them if I ever experienced anything similar again. That's when I decided to come by today."
Dr. Szozas nods at me, "And did you have any dreams or visions about an old woman? Or anyone else, maybe?"
I shake my head, "No, just that one dream, although there was something else that happened before that, too. About two months ago, I was sleeping at night, and I heard someone calling me. The voice sounded familiar, but I didn't recognize it at first. Then I realized that it sounded like my mother -- but she died years ago! So I went downstairs, to see what it was. But I saw nothing except shadows and shapes moving around in the dark, and that made me really frightened. So I ran upstairs to bed."
The doctor sits quietly for a moment, thinking about what I've

My name is Danni."
He nods, and then asks, "And why did you decide to seek treatment?"
"Well...it all started this morning, after waking up..." I tell him. My voice trails off, because it feels strange talking about such intimate details in front of another person. But Dr. Szozas isn't fazed by anything, he just listens attentively, nodding along with me as I continue.
"...and I can't get back to sleep, and I keep thinking about things, and I feel like there's something wrong with me, and I want help figuring out what it is, and what needs doing about it, and..." And I trail off again, unable to find any words, and I know I'm babbling.
But Dr. Szozas doesn't seem bothered. He simply sits forward, placing his elbows on his knees, leaning toward me, and he looks me straight in the eye, and he speaks slowly, deliberately, "Danni, do you think you might have been abused sexually or physically as a child? Have you ever experienced flashbacks of sexual abuse, either while awake or asleep?"
Oh god, I hope not! I don't even know if I would recognize an event as being abusive. It was never really talked about much growing up, we were too busy getting ready to go to school. The only time it came up was when I asked about sex education, and Mom told me that she'd rather I didn't ask questions like that, that it wasn't appropriate. She said that I should wait until I got older before learning those kinds of things. I guess that meant that she thought that maybe they weren't taught to kids at her high school, but I had no idea.
So I shake my head, no, I've never felt that way. I'm pretty sure that I'm normal, but I'm still nervous that Dr. Szozas will be able to see through

My name is Rosemary Sorensen." I pause there, wondering if this is the right decision? What would happen if I had gone to another doctor? How much does he know about me already? But then again, maybe this is just what I need. A professional opinion. Maybe he can help me figure things out.
He nods slowly, and says, "And you've been experiencing...?"
I nod slowly, too, because it feels like a big deal to say something out loud about all this stuff going on inside of me. And I feel like if I don't speak now, I might never get a chance to tell anyone else about it. Or worse, they'll think I'm crazy.
So I start talking, telling him about my thoughts racing through my mind, and about how I keep seeing images in my head, and hearing voices in my ear. When I finish, Dr. Szozas sits quietly, staring off into space. He looks like he's deep in thought, but his face is expressionless. It doesn't seem like he understands what I said or what I'm saying. That bothers me a little, but I decide to press on anyway.
"What do you think?" I ask, trying not to sound impatient.
He sighs, "It sounds pretty serious, but I don't have any idea what it means. You should probably see a psychiatrist; that is where they specialize, after all. There are others who work with people who experience similar symptoms, but I am familiar with Dr. Szas' reputation, and his practice focuses primarily on unusual cases. I'd recommend that we schedule an appointment for Monday morning, at 9am sharp."
That's when I realize that Dr. Szas isn't listening to me. Instead, his attention is focused elsewhere. His hazel eyes are locked onto a spot on his desk, his lips are pursed together, his brow furrowed, his jaw

My name is Anna Marie Harris."
He nods his head, and asks, "And why have you chosen to seek treatment?"
So I start talking...and I tell him all about my experiences thus far: the dreams, the nightmares, the voices in my head telling me horrible things, and then the images flashing through my mind while awake. The doctor listens intently, nodding along, asking questions occasionally. When I finish speaking, he looks at me thoughtfully for several moments before responding.
"It sounds very similar to what we call Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). Do you know much about this condition? It can be quite debilitating, if left untreated."
I shake my head 'no', and answer, "No, not really. I've only heard stories about it, and seen pictures online..."
Dr. Szozas smiles at me again, and continues, "Anna, do you recall anything about your life prior to coming to our facility?"
"Well, I was born in New York City, and I lived there until age 11. Then my parents moved to North Carolina, where they met each other, got married, and started their family. My father worked at the airport, and my mother did various jobs to support us financially. We had an older brother named Michael, who died when he was 18. After that, we lost contact with them completely -- I don't even remember my mom's last name anymore!"
The doctor chuckles softly, and I continue, "After that, I went back to living with my grandparents. I graduated high school, and I took college courses at night. After graduating, I came to California to work at a hotel -- but I quit after six months because it didn't suit me. So I decided to travel, and I ended up working at a resort in Mexico -- that lasted two years, and I quit to become a nanny -- that turned into a housekeeper position at a home.
