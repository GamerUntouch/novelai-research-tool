  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Alexandra Zabini.\" I pause again before continuing, \"Alexandra... uh...\" I don't know what to call myself now. It feels wrong somehow to use my real last name, but it's also too long. I can shorten it easily enough, but there's something more important than just being shorter.\n\"Your middle name?\" He prompts gently, and I think briefly about my parents' wishes. My father wanted to honor them by naming me after his mother, while my mother wanted to honor her father, thus they split their votes between 'Zabini', which honors both sides of my heritage, and 'Carruthers', which honors my paternal grandfather. But ultimately my mom won out, because she had been named after her grandmother – a woman that she loved very much, and I thought was beautiful.\nSo I answer, \"Anna Maria,\" then add, \"and I came here today to talk about what happened earlier this week.\"\nDr. Szozas nods, and asks me to tell him all about it.\nAs I recount the events of Tuesday morning, I feel that I'm telling a stranger about a particularly distressing dream. The details seem strange to me, but I believe that I am remembering accurately. I am surprised to find that I am able to describe the entire incident so clearly, even though I was terrified to go through with it.\nAfter I finish describing the incident to Dr. Szozas, I wait expectantly for his reaction. He sits quietly, and ponders the story, thinking deeply about the various possibilities that I have presented.\nFinally, Dr. Szozas speaks, \"It sounds to me like you were under extreme stress at the time of the incident, Alexandra. You were scared out of your mind, and I doubt that you fully understood the consequences of the actions that you took. As a result, I suspect that the trauma that you experienced was a form of post-traumatic",

    " you've known each other long enough to get married, but not long enough to know what was wrong with you?\"\n\"Exactly!\"\nDr. Szozas smiles again, \"That sounds normal",
    " to me. That makes sense. Now tell me about the events leading up to the last few days.\"\nI recount the story: I was feeling great, I thought everything was fine; then I",
    " got sick. My body felt funny, I couldn't breathe right, I lost weight, my hair fell out, and I grew fur. And I became very aggressive, violent even, almost killing myself",
    ".\nDr. Szosas asks me to elaborate.\n\"You know about the incident with the car accident, the one that killed the woman I loved?\" I ask.\n\"Yes,",
    " I read about that. You caused an accident because you suddenly went crazy, didn't you?\"\n\"No, I don't think I'm insane,\" I say quietly. \"I'm pretty sure",
    " I'm still sane.\"\n\"But you have no idea why you are acting the way you are now. Why is that?\"\n\"There's something different about me that I can't quite put",
    " into words yet. I feel like I'm losing control, but I don't understand why I would lose control. I'm scared. I need help.\" I look at the doctor with pleading eyes."

I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded.

Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

I can't seem to get any restful sleep, even though I'm exhausted after working all day. And I have nightmares sometimes...\"\nDr. Szozas smiles, \"How long has this been happening?\"\n\"For several weeks now,\" I answer.\nHe leans forward, and rests his elbows on his knees, \"Have you ever considered taking medication? There may be something that will help you relax more easily.\"\n\"No,\" I shake my head adamantly. I feel a little defensive about the subject, but I know there's nothing wrong with trying medication if it works. \"But I want to try talking about it instead. Is that alright?\"\n\"Of course,\" he responds. \"We'll start by getting you comfortable enough to talk about what's bothering you. Please describe your dreams or visions.\"\nSo I do. I tell him about the strange dream where I saw myself being chased through the forest, and about the weird vision that I had when I was a kid, watching people die horribly at night.\nDr. Szozas listens intently, occasionally asking questions to clarify details. When I finish describing the nightmare I had last week, he tells me that I should try to go back to bed tonight, and that I shouldn't worry about the dreams until morning.\nWhen I leave his office, I am feeling better than I have felt in days. I walk out into the bright sunshine, and I breathe deeply, enjoying the air on my face. The sun feels good on my shoulders, warming me up.\nAs I'm walking home from the doctor, I think about the way he looked at me with those kind, intelligent eyes, and I wonder if I'm imagining things about his looks.

State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
