Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

What do you think might happen?\"\nI tell him about the web sites I've been visiting, about being unable to sleep, about seeing things... And then I tell him about the dreams, and the strange feeling in my body when I wake up after sleeping. He listens intently, nodding along, asking questions now and again. When I finish speaking, he sits back in his chair, his face thoughtful.\n\"So you think you may be having some sort of psychotic break? A schizophrenic episode?\"\n\"Yes sir, I'm not sure if that's right or not, but that sounds about right.\"\n\"Well, let me ask you a few questions: Do you hear voices? See visions?\"\n\"No, I haven't heard any voices, but I did have a dream last night where I saw a woman get torn apart by dogs, and she was screaming at me to stop them, but I couldn't move. I woke up covered with sweat, and I felt sick afterwards.\"\n\"Hmm. Well, let me go check a couple of things. Stay seated please.\"\nAs I watch him walk out into the hall, I realize that I am trembling. I try to control myself, but I can't. I wonder what is going to happen. Will I be sent home?

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

He listens intently, occasionally asking questions. When I finish speaking, he sits forward again, resting his elbows on his knees and clasping his hands together, \"So...you say that something bad happened to you, and yet you don't want to elaborate further? Why is that?\"\n\"Because I'm scared,\" I admit, \"and I'm worried that if I tell anyone else about it, they'll think I've gone insane or something. They might even call the police!\"\nHe smiles reassuringly, \"Why would that bother you? You have nothing to hide; I promise you, we won't report anything unless you ask us to do so.\"\n\"But people will find out about it eventually. And I can't stop thinking about it.\"\nDr. Szozas nods slowly, \"You're right; I understand. If I were to write about it, I'd probably get a lot more than just 'some girl had a dream.' But I also understand that you are frightened by the idea that others may not believe you. It's understandable; I'm sure that most doctors wouldn't either, especially after reading a few case studies about things that sound similar to yours. So I'm going to put myself in your place; I'll pretend that I am a doctor, and I am seeing a patient with a very strange condition.

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Samantha White.\"\nHe smiles again, \"That's quite alright, just call me Mike.\"\nMike asks me questions about myself: what do I do? Where did I go to school? What brought me there today? How long have I been feeling this way? Have I ever had any mental health issues before? Has anyone else noticed anything strange about me lately? It goes on like that for about 30 minutes or more, and I answer all his questions honestly, because I trust him implicitly.\nThen we get to talking about my dreams. I tell him about them, and then I ask him if they are abnormal or not. He laughs, \"No, nothing wrong with dreaming about sex. In fact, that's one of the most common things people dream about. They often become sexualized by their subconscious mind, which can be very pleasurable.\"\nWe talk about other subjects too, mostly personal stuff, and I learn that he is single, living alone, and that he enjoys reading, traveling, cooking, writing poetry, playing chess, and practicing yoga. His only hobby is collecting antique firearms.\nWhen the time comes to end our session, I feel much better than when I came in. I leave his office, promising to follow up with him next week.\nAs I walk out into the hallway, I hear voices coming from a nearby room. Curious, I open the door to find a young couple having a discussion with a doctor that looks to be about 50 years old. The man is a handsome older gentleman with a friendly smile and kind brown eyes, while the woman is a striking redhead with a bright, bubbly personality. She is wearing a blue dress that shows off her voluptuous body to its best advantage.\nThe man introduces himself to me, \"Hello, I'm Dr. Michael Szozas; I've been taking care of Ms. Katheryn here, and I'm happy to say she is doing wonderfully.",

Maybe I shouldn't give them.\nBut I answer anyway, \"Because I think I may be losing control of myself.\"\nA few seconds go by, before Dr. Szozas responds, \"Tell me more about what is happening.\"\nSo I describe my day: my encounter with the strange man, the web page I found, and how I had begun reading the words on the screen, until I couldn't stop. How I'd felt so drawn to the words, almost hypnotized. \"It was like a drug\", I explain, \"and I just kept reading and reading...\"\n\"What were you doing while you read the words?\", he asks. He looks curious, but not alarmed. His expression tells me that he already knows the answer to that.\n\"Nothing much really,\" I reply. I remember the feeling of wanting to sleep, but I hadn't done that yet; I had spent most of the afternoon watching the TV, eating lunch, and now I was sitting in his office.\nDr. Szozas is nodding along with me, apparently satisfied with my explanation. I wonder if I'm going to be OK.\n\"Did anything unusual happen to you after you read the text?\", he asks.\n\"No, nothing that I recall\", I lie. I'm starting to worry that I'll be labeled crazy if I admit to any weird behavior. I glance at the door to the outer office.\nDr. Szoz",
