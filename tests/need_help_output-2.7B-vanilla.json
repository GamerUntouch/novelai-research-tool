   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Karen. I'm a junior in college, and I'm here for a consultation with Dr. Szozas.\"\nDr. Szozas responds, \"Well, that's a very good start. I'm glad that you've come to me. I'm going to need to ask you some questions to get a better sense of what's going on with you. I'll be right back.\"\nHe walks over to the door, and opens it, \"Please wait here for a moment.\"\nDr. Szozas returns, and he sits down in a chair across from me, \"So, you're Karen, and you're here for a consultation with me. I'm going to ask you some questions, and I'm going to need you to tell me the truth. If you lie to me, I'll know, and I'll know that you're lying to me. Do you understand?\"\n\"Yes,\" I respond, and I'm afraid that I do.\nHe continues, \"Tell me about your life, Karen. What do you do for fun? What do you like to do?\"\nI can't believe I'm telling this man my entire life story, but I have to. I tell him, \"I'm a sophomore at a small college in the Midwest. I'm a member of a club on campus, and I love to go to the movies, and I love to read. I like to read romance novels, and I love to go to the mall. I also like to go to concerts, and I love to go to the gym. I'm a very active person, and I love to go to the beach, and I love to go to the mountains. I also love to go on long walks, and I love to go to the zoo.\"\nDr. Szozas looks at me, \"So, you like to travel, huh?\"\nI nod, \"I do, and I like to go to",
