So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

I can't put my finger on it, but there's definitely something wrong.\nDr. Szozas continues, \"So tell me about yourself. Where did you grow up? What do you enjoy?\"\nWell, that's easy enough: \"I grew up in a village called Halkara Village, where we live in a house by the river. We raise chickens and pigs, and our fields produce wheat, barley, and vegetables. My favorite things to do are cooking and drawing pictures, though I also like reading manga comics. In terms of hobbies, I would say gardening is most important to us. Also, we all know how to play musical instruments. You probably don't need to hear about that.\"\nDr. Szozas nods thoughtfully, \"Hmm...it sounds like a happy life. Is that correct?\"\n\"That is correct. I really think it is!\"\n\"Then I will ask you a question: Are you satisfied with your current situation?\"\nThis is getting weird. I haven't done anything yet that I'm dissatisfied with, but I'm starting to get that feeling. I've never been asked that before.\n\"Why are you asking me that?\"\n\"It is an important part of the process, to determine whether or not you are content with your life. There are many different ways to answer that question, but I'm going to go with the one that I'm thinking about myself.

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Falfa.\" That's all I say. The silence stretches between us until finally, Dr. Szozas speaks again: \"And why did you decide to seek help?\"\nNow it's my turn to pause, thinking back to what happened yesterday. This time I feel more confident speaking about it. It feels good to tell this story aloud, even if only to myself. \"Yesterday, I went to go get dinner with Shalsha and Vania... And then they were gone...\" My voice trails off.\nDr. Szozas nods slowly. \"Yes, let's start there,\" he says. \"You said you went to get dinner with them, yes? What time was that?\"\n\"Um, seven thirty. We had lunch together earlier today, though, and we ate right after that, and by the time we finished eating, it was almost eight o'clock...\"\nDr. Szozas looks at me intently. \"How do you know that was when they left?\"\n\"Because I saw the sun setting outside the window. They always leave before the sun sets.\"\nHe raises an eyebrow, \"Do you remember anything else about that day? Anything strange or unusual that might have been happening with them?\"\n\"No, nothing really stands out to me... I just assumed that they'd already eaten, because I didn't hear any sounds coming from the kitchen...\"\n\"So you assume that they've already eaten, and you don't think about whether or not that is true?\"\n\"Well, I guess I wasn't paying attention at the time. I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be rude. I'm just saying that I'm a little tired...\"\n\"Is that all that you can recall about the day that they disappeared?\"\n\"Pretty much. I may be able to come up with something if I try hard enough, but I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't be able to put it",

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

I think something might have happened to me recently.\" I say this hesitantly, because I'm afraid that if I speak too soon, I'll lose all courage. But then I decide that there isn't any reason to hold back. If anything, I feel better talking about it now rather than later.\n\"Yes? What do you mean by 'something'? And when did it happen?\" He asks, leaning forward intently, waiting patiently for my answer.\n\"It's hard to explain exactly. It feels like I've lost control of myself somehow. Like I can't stop doing things without thinking about them first. I get angry easily. Sometimes I just want to cry, but I can't. My body won't move when I want it to.\" I pause for breath, then continue, \"But most importantly, sometimes I can't remember what I was supposed to be doing before I became aware of myself. Things seem strange, and I'm not sure if they are memories or dreams or if I'm imagining the whole thing. I'm not sure if I'm real or not anymore, if I'm really alive or not. I'm scared, Doctor.\" I'm not sure if I should call him that yet or not. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to call anyone that or not.\nDr. Szozas doesn't rush me, and he simply listens to me carefully, nodding occasionally. When I finish, I wait a moment to collect my thoughts.\n\"Do you know where you are right now?\"\n\"No, I don't know if I am anywhere at all.\"\n\"What about the people around you? Do you recognize them?\"\n\"",
