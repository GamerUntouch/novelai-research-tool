Oiran are a specific category of high ranking Japanese courtesans.. Divided into a number of ranks within this category, oiran were considered – both in social terms and in the entertainment they provided – to be above common prostitutes, known as yūjo, women of pleasure. Though oiran by definition also engaged in prostitution, they were distinguished by their skills in the traditional arts, with the higher-ranking oiran having a degree of choice in which customers they took.
After long service, the memory of my dead wife doesn’t cause a pang in my heart when I see a pretty desirable woman. So now I’m in Kyoto's Red Light district, looking for an okiya, a Japanese pleasure house, with a pretty girl that I could have fun with. The street is very quiet tonight, and the red lanterns that give the district its names are lit. There aren't many lights on or people out walking at this time of night, so it looks like most of the residents are either home getting ready for bed, or just gone to some other location.  Not too far away from here, there is an old shrine on a hill that overlooks the city, but not to worry about that for now.  This is where I need to be, not to worry about anything else.
Ahead of me, there is a short, narrow alleyway between two buildings. It isn't crowded here, as I've seen no one since coming to this side of town. As I'm walking down this narrow alleyway, I can hear soft music emanating from somewhere inside a building along the way. A light shines through a gap in the door to a house opposite me, and I notice that there are quite a few windows open above it, which means someone is probably playing music and enjoying themselves inside. I look for the sign that might indicate that it’s an okiya where I might find an oiran. The kanji characters confirm my suspicion, and I knock politely at the door.
