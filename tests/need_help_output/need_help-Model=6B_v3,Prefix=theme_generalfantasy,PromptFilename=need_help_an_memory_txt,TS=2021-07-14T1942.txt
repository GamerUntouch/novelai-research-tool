=== Prompt ========================================
I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.

[Year: 2020 AD]
[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "


=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Saren Arterius."
"Saren? That's a lovely name." He smiles again. "And where do you live?"
"In New York City."
"Doing what?"
"Working for an investment bank. They've been having layoffs recently, and I don't have a job anymore." I sigh, and I feel myself getting teary eyed, and I try to stop this. I continue, "But I can get another one. It just needs to happen soon, before I lose my apartment."
He nods sympathetically, and he looks away for a moment, then back at me, "Tell me about the issues you want help with."
I tell him about my relationship problems. I explain that I'm not sure if they are real, or if I'm just projecting my own feelings onto them. I talk about my fear of commitment, and my lack of confidence, and I describe my difficulty in making decisions.   I tell him how I find men attractive, but I avoid dating because I'm afraid I'll end up being hurt. I confess my loneliness, and my desire for companionship. I admit my sadness, and my sense of inadequacy. I tell him how I've always wanted a family, but I never knew the right time or the right person to meet. I tell him all my fears, and my insecurities, and my doubts and my anxieties. I share my desires, and my dreams, and my hopes. I reveal my fantasies, and my sexual urges, and my lusts. I speak my deepest thoughts, and my darkest secrets, my most intimate and personal concerns. I bare my soul to him.
Dr. Szozas listens attentively, his face is attentive and thoughtful, and his eyes remain fixed on me. I am surprised to realize how much I trust him already. I think I'm falling in love. I know I should be careful with my

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is JT, and I'm here because I have been having problems."
He nods thoughtfully, "Can you tell me about those problems?"
"Well, there's this woman named Angela, and she works at our company..." I start talking, telling him all about her, and then about my feelings. I get lost in the story, but eventually I finish, and I feel better for doing so.
Dr. Szozas listens attentively throughout, nodding occasionally. When I finished, he asks, "Have you ever had any sexual contact with another person before?   Have you masturbated recently? Or even fantasized about sex?"
I shake my head, "No. No, I haven't done either one yet. But lately, especially since Angela started dating my boss, I've gotten very horny, and I think I might do both now!"
Dr. Szozas smiles at me, "That sounds pretty normal to me. Have you considered taking a break from work, just for a little while, and giving yourself time off for a bit? You know, a vacation or something, maybe a couple days away from the office would help, and give you a chance to relax and recharge your batteries. I'm sure that Angela is a great girl, and I can imagine how hard it must be for you to deal with the situation, and to keep up appearances at work. It's probably a lot more stressful than you realize, and if you don't give yourself a mental break, you'll end up getting a stress-related illness or worse. A few days of rest will help to clear your mind and relieve the pressure, and you may find that the problem is solved without resorting to drastic measures. I recommend you try to stay calm and collected, and not let the situation become too much for you. I'm sure that things are going to turn out fine, and I wish you luck in dealing with it."
I

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Alana, I live in California. I have been married twice before, both times were very bad experiences." My mind wanders off, remembering all the things wrong about those relationships, "They just weren't right for me."
He nods sympathetically, "That sounds awful. What did they do?"
I sigh, "Well...   They didn't treat me right. They never showed any interest in me, or our relationship, and they treated me poorly." I pause for a moment, considering what else I can say, "I was always the one being ignored. I think they felt threatened by me, or something. I don't know exactly what happened; maybe we should start there..."
I close my eyes for a second, trying to remember the details, "I guess I'll tell you the whole story if you want. It's not really a big deal." I open my eyes again, "I've had three marriages already, but the last two ended badly. The first marriage, I thought I'd found the perfect guy; I met him at a party, and I fell in love instantly. He seemed to care for me a lot, but I found out later that he really only wanted sex. I tried talking to him about my feelings, but I couldn't get through to him; he would just ignore me. I decided to give up on the idea of a serious relationship, and I moved on to the next person.
I dated a few guys after that, and I found myself falling in love with them, and I believed I was in love, too. I kept thinking that this time, I wouldn't be hurt. But then I discovered the problem, and I realized that I really wasn't in love.
I went to a therapist, and she told me that I needed to break up with the men I liked, and move on to find someone better. She said I needed a partner who loved me and

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Alyssa Davenport, and I have been having trouble sleeping."
He nods encouragingly, and then asks, "And why do you think this might be?"
"Well, I've been thinking about something for quite a while now, and I haven't been able to get any sleep because of it. It's making things difficult for me at work too."
Dr. Szozas sits back, and leans forward, placing his elbows on his knees, "Tell me what you were thinking about, Miss Davenport."
So I tell him the story, starting with my life growing up in rural Indiana, and finishing up at the University of Miami where I met my husband. I talk about our wedding day, and how happy we both seemed to be. I describe the honeymoon trip, and how excited I was to start my new life together.
I continue, "We moved to New York City, and I was hired by a company called 'Honeybee'. I was very enthusiastic and energetic, and I was doing well there. I had a great boss, but I was still unhappy. I couldn't figure out why I was feeling so unfulfilled at work. I started to wonder if I was being taken advantage of. I was working for a big corporation that was paying me a lot of money, and yet I was the one who was running the show. I was the only female in my department, and I felt I was getting less respect than the men. I would occasionally catch my boss staring at my breasts, and I didn't know if it was my imagination or not. I thought I must be imagining it. I tried to ignore the situation, but I couldn't help myself from wondering sometimes if I should just quit.
"I began to feel that I was a failure as a woman. I wanted to be a good wife, and mother, and a strong professional, and I wasn't achieving all those

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Elizabeth Blythe. My parents named me after their favorite author, Elizabeth George, which they had read aloud to them many times before I was born."
He nods slowly, "That makes sense," he responds, then pauses for a moment.   "How long have you been seeing this counselor?"
I pause, wondering if I should tell him about the issue that brought me to him. But I decide against it. It doesn't seem relevant, and I don't want to burden him with something trivial. Instead, I answer honestly, "Since yesterday morning."
"And what was the cause of your visit today? I assume that there is a problem that you've come for help with," he asks, and I can feel the tension in his voice.
I sigh, "Yes, I think I need counseling..."
"So I take it that you aren't ready for the 'why' yet, but you know that you need therapy. What is the specific reason for your desire for treatment?"
I shrug a little, and I reply, "Well, I just need a break from being a mom, and I need a way to deal with my kids' issues."
Dr. Szozas smiles at me and replies, "I see. I'll start by asking a few questions, but I'd appreciate if you would allow me to ask anything I may need to. This is a safe place, where we can discuss any and all topics without judgment or preconceptions. I understand that you are a mother, and I respect the challenges and responsibilities that go along with such a role. So, please, continue."
I nod, and I begin, "I'm not sure if I am a good mother. I feel like my kids do most things better than I ever did. They are always happy, never complain, and I'm constantly worrying and second guessing myself for not doing a better job as their parent. I wish I

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Amy Smith." I pause, thinking about where this story is headed. I have never told anyone anything remotely close to this before. Why now? What makes this time different than all the other times I've been afraid, ashamed, embarrassed, humiliated, and just plain scared shitless?
"Amy, tell me more about you, what do you want?" he asks, gently. I feel myself relax. It feels good to talk about something else besides myself.
So I continue, "Well, my boyfriend of three years broke up with me last week.  He said we were moving too fast, and that he wanted to slow things down... or maybe even move on..." I begin, but then stop. Something is wrong, very wrong.
Dr. Szozas looks at me quizzically, "You don't seem upset by any of that. Are you sure you aren't feeling alright?"
I try to smile at him, "No, I'm fine. It's just... it was a little hard for me to hear him say those words. That's not the way he talks normally. And I know he didn't really break up with me, he was just saying goodbye. But I felt like I was losing my best friend. I was devastated, and I was really confused. I was sure I was doing something to drive him away. I thought I was being selfish, and I was sure I needed to change. I was also terrified because I couldn't figure out how I lost my confidence, my self-esteem, and my ability to trust people. I was sure I had done something to ruin my relationship, but I wasn't sure what I did. I knew I was a terrible girlfriend, I was always late, I was a horrible cook, I made him uncomfortable, I got drunk at parties, and I was a total bitch to my friends. I tried to be better, but I still sucked at relationships. I didn't

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Jane Smith."
He smiles gently, and asks, "And why are you here?"
Well, this is awkward. What should I tell him? I don't know where to start. Maybe I can just say something vague and general, and then we'll work backwards until I get closer to the truth.   I decide to go with the approach of honesty, but not too much, "It's... difficult to put into words. It involves things that have happened to me, and I've been having trouble dealing with them. I think maybe there's something wrong with me. Or perhaps not; maybe it's just a phase or something. I don't really know what the problem is, but I feel lost and confused about a lot of stuff."
Dr. Szozas leans forward, his eyes intent on mine, "Tell me more. Tell me exactly what is happening, and how I might help you."
So I do. I describe the events leading up to the present, and I try to explain the feelings I had while they were happening. I mention the voices, the strange dreams, and the memories. I talk about the way I felt when I was in the forest, and the feeling of being watched. I describe the things I did after I returned home. I'm nervous, and my hands shake. I wish I'd brought a cup of coffee; I need caffeine badly. I sip my water, and I'm sweating.
After I finish, I wait for a reaction. I expect a lecture, a scolding, a warning; I expected the doctor to give me a stern talking-to. Instead, his eyes widen, and his smile widens, and his face is lit up by a gentle, loving glow. I'm surprised; his eyes seem to be glowing.
I look at him curiously, "You're smiling!"
"I am indeed," he chuckles, "because you are a very special

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Sarah Elizabeth Jameson. My father passed away three years ago. I've been living off social security benefits since then."
He nods, and asks, "What brought this on?"
"It started a few months after Dad died...it feels like something just changed inside of me. It doesn't feel right anymore. Something is missing, but I don't know what it is. I can't explain it any better than that..." I say, frustrated by my inability to articulate the issue.
"Can you describe it for me? How did things start to change for you?"
I think about that question, and I try to recall the exact moment when my life took a different direction. "I guess it was sometime in late summer when I noticed that there were fewer people in my neighborhood. The houses have become vacant for a while now; even the mailboxes are empty. There used to be a family across the street, a mom and dad and two little kids. Now they live on the other side of town, and I haven't seen them for a long time. I wonder if the house is still standing, or if it burned down or anything.
"I remember one day when I came home, and I found a woman in my apartment. She had red hair, and she seemed to be homeless. I didn't want her in my place, and I asked her to leave. I called the police, and the cops showed up, and I tried to tell them the truth, I said, 'This is my apartment.' But the cop wouldn't listen. He arrested the lady for trespassing, and I never saw her again.
"I went to a new doctor, and I told him my symptoms, and he diagnosed me with depression. He gave me a prescription for an antidepressant, and I took the pills. I stopped going to school, and I stayed at home, and I got more depressed.
"I thought I was

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Alyssia."
He nods, and then continues, "Alyssia...why did you decide to seek counseling?"
I start to answer, but pause again, and instead say, "I don't know where else to turn. I've been feeling very uncomfortable lately, and I have no idea what's wrong with me. It feels like something inside me is broken, or twisted, or maybe just warped somehow. I want this to stop. I need help. I feel lost, confused, angry, sad..."
Dr. Szozas smiles at me, and puts a finger to his lips, "Shhhh, let's not jump ahead too much. Tell me more about the things you said earlier."
I nod, and continue, "It started when my boyfriend broke up with me, and I was devastated and heartbroken. I was really upset for a while, and I didn't really do anything, except cry a lot. But I felt like I was losing my mind, and I was having trouble sleeping. I would wake up at night, and I'd think of all the reasons that my ex was right, and I was stupid, and I was worthless, and I wasn't good enough for him, and I was never going to get another chance at happiness. I was a failure, and I was a waste of space, and I was a horrible person for even being in his life. I was a bad girlfriend, and I deserved to be treated poorly by a jerk. I thought I was a terrible human being, and I hated myself. I wanted to die, because I was a total disappointment.
"But then I met a friend, and she made me realize that my self-loathing was misplaced. She helped me see the real reason for my misery. I had a couple of great relationships in my past, and they were wonderful, and I loved them deeply. And yet I couldn't keep any of them,

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Mary Jane Watson." And then I pause, waiting for the next question, but nothing more happens. My heart starts pounding, and I feel myself blushing, embarrassed by my own admission, but also excited by this new encounter. I can barely breathe, and I realize that I have never been in such close proximity to a beautiful, handsome man before. I want to say something else, I want to tell him about my issues, but I don't know what to do, or even if I should, and so I just remain silent.
Dr. Szozas continues to study me, taking his time, "You seem to be doing fine, MJWatson; please continue."
I nod my head, and I reply, "Thank you."
He smiles at me, and I smile back, "So, why are you here?"
This is where things get awkward. I had hoped to avoid having to talk about my problems for now, but I'm not sure I can hide them forever. I've spent my whole life hiding, and I'd rather not start again. I'm not sure I'll ever stop being ashamed of my past, and I wonder, will I ever forgive myself for the choices I made?
But I decide to go for it, "I was hoping that I would find a counselor I could trust. I was hoping to discuss my...issues..." I trail off, and I watch as Dr. Szozas nods his understanding, and his face becomes grave.
I swallow hard, "I was raped last year, and I've struggled to deal with the aftermath of the assault. I was afraid that I might hurt my boyfriend, and I didn't know how to handle the situation, and I ended up hurting everyone. But I think I'm finally getting the help I need."
I reach out my hand to touch his forearm, "I'm sorry, I shouldn't have brought up my rape, and I
