My name is Amy." I pause again before continuing, because this will probably be hard enough without adding 'the Psychic'. But I don't want to seem disrespectful either, so I continue: "Amy Davenport. My husband died three years ago, and I've been having weird dreams since then." And I tell him all about them.
He listens intently, nodding occasionally as I speak. When I finish, he asks me a few questions, mostly to get more details about the dream content. As I answer his questions, I realize just how much detail there is to remember. The only problem is that I can't recall anything else about the dream after that first night. It was too vivid, too real, I feel like I actually saw what happened.
After we conclude our interview, Dr. Szozas tells me that I have nothing to worry about, and that he'll call me back within two weeks to schedule another session. He also reminds me that I should not discuss any of the information I shared with anyone else, especially family members or friends. "It's best if everyone thinks I'm crazy anyway."
When I leave his office, I feel better than I did when I arrived. There is a lot to think about; I need to decide whether to share the story with others, I wonder how I would react to seeing a psychiatrist, I need to figure out a way to deal with the fact that I may be delusional...
The next day I wake up early to go to work. I walk into the office, and I'm greeted by a familiar face; I smile at Mr. Johnson, one of the partners, who gives me a wave. I was surprised to find that I had to wait until 10am to meet with Dr. Szozas; I was expecting to see him right away.
The office is busy; I know that I shouldn't be talking to clients while I am working, but I am distracted. I am

My name is Katherine."
He nods, and smiles again. "That's good. Now tell me, what brings you to see me?"
It feels strange to say this out loud, and I feel myself blush slightly as I continue: "Well, I've been having trouble sleeping lately. It started just after Thanksgiving break, and now... I can't get to sleep at night anymore."
"Is there anything else? Any other symptoms you have noticed?" he asks.
There is something about the way he speaks, very professional yet friendly, that makes me relax a little more, "Yeah, um..." I pause, trying to think of what might come next.
"You mentioned difficulty sleeping before. Do you ever wake up during the night? Or do you find yourself waking up early in the morning?"
Oh dear, I'm getting caught up in his questions, and I try to keep things calm. "Yes, yes I do. Sometimes I'll wake up suddenly at 2am or 3am, and I'm wide awake. And then sometimes I will go back to bed, and I still won't be able to sleep. My mind races all day long."
Dr. Szozas listens intently, and I watch him nod his head periodically as I speak. He leans forward with his elbows resting on his knees, his hands clasped together, his gaze fixed upon me. His face is serious and attentive, but not intimidating; he looks like a grandfatherly man that would be sitting by the fire with a cup of tea while telling a story to his grandchildren.
As I finish speaking, I realize that I am smiling. I don't know if it's a nervous smile, but I am happy to be talking to him about this stuff. I hope that I'm not making a fool out of myself.
"And that is the extent of the problems that I am experiencing. Is that enough to warrant an appointment with a psychiatrist?"

My name is Katherine O'Connor." I pause, wondering where this is leading.   My head tilts slightly to one side as I consider what I should say next. The room grows silent, save for the sound of our breathing. My heart pounds hard against my chest, and my palms become sweaty. I know what I have to do, but I don't want to hurt anyone by saying something stupid. This doctor knows people, and if I can just get through this meeting without embarrassing myself...
"Well, Ms. O'Connor, let's start off by getting to know each other better. Tell me about yourself? Where did you grow up?" He asks gently, almost playfully. It feels good to talk to somebody, anybody, and I answer, "Oh, I grew up in a small town called New Salem, Illinois. I went to school there until I graduated high school, then I moved away to attend college in Chicago. That's where I met Paul."
He nods, taking notes. "And tell me about Paul. What does he do for a living?"
I swallow nervously, remembering all too well the night when I had a screaming match with Paul after we got home from dinner at the restaurant; he had been angry because I wouldn't go along with his plan to go back to the hotel to fuck his secretary, I'd said no way! and I stormed out the door, leaving a drunken Paul behind.
I try to keep the story short, but it is difficult, as I recall the arguments that ensued, the fights that broke out between us; I remember the police being summoned to break up the ruckus, and I remember the day I left with a suitcase and never returned; I also remember the nights spent alone, crying into the pillow, the days that were filled with nothing but work, trying to pay the bills, trying to put food on the table; I remembered the depression that set in, the self

My name is Evelyn. And I'm really not sure why I'm here."
He smiles again, "That's understandable. Why don't we start by asking questions?"
This isn't easy for me, because I've never been good at talking to people about myself. But then, I suppose this is one way to learn more about what makes me tick... maybe even get some answers? Asking questions feels natural to me, so I begin, "OK, let's do that..."
"Why did you choose psychiatry?"
Oh boy, that's an awkward question, especially since I have no idea why I chose it. "I guess because I thought I might find something there that would help me understand my own mind better, or maybe even cure me of whatever was bothering me."
"And does understanding your mind and curing yourself sound appealing to you right now?"
Hmm, that was a toughie. I want to say yes, but I also know that I'm not ready yet. "Not really, no. It sounds hard work, but I think I need to try harder to accept things about myself that are difficult for me to face."
Dr. Szozas nods his head, "You seem very honest, which is refreshing. I believe that honesty is an important trait to possess. Now tell me about the changes that are occurring within your body, please?"
So I give a brief summary of the symptoms that I mentioned earlier, but I leave out the parts where I feel that I am losing control of my bodily functions. I figure that I'll just go ahead and ask him about them when I can be sure that I won't lose control.
"What kind of medications are you taking at present?"
"Um, none that I know of, I haven't had any prescriptions filled for anything. I went to a naturopath once before, but she said that I didn't need anything at the time. I was pretty

My name is Nefertiti."
He looks confused by this answer, "Neferti? Are you Egyptian?"
"No, I just liked the sound of it. It sounds exotic, mysterious... sexy..." I giggle nervously, trying to cover myself up.
He smiles again, then leans back in his chair and crosses his legs. A moment later, he asks, "Would you mind telling me what happened after you came across the web page?"
So I tell him about finding the website, about the images, and all the comments. He listens intently until I finish. When I get to the part where I masturbated to the pictures, he sits forward in his chair, leaning closer to me than before. His face is now only inches away from mine, and he speaks softly, "Did you do anything else while looking through those pages?"
I blush, but I nod yes, "Yes, I did. But it wasn't bad -- I was careful not to touch myself too much, because I didn't want to leave any marks or DNA samples behind. I wanted to be sure I got rid of them completely."
He nods slowly, "It makes sense that you'd want to be extra cautious. Do you think you were influenced somehow by the site?"
Now I'm really embarrassed, and I try to change the subject, but I can't seem to find the right words to say. I look at the floor instead, "Well, I don't know if I was 'influenced', but I definitely had an orgasm when I saw the last picture."
He smiles at me reassuringly, "That's good. That means that you weren't actually hypnotized, but that you have some kind of psychological reaction to the site that is making you feel that way. We'll talk about that later."
Then I hear a voice in the background, and I look up to see a woman walking into the room,

My name is MaryAnn, and...well..." I pause again, trying to find the right words, "it all started after I saw this post online." I point to one of several web pages open on the computer monitor next to us. It is titled 'A Beautiful Mind'. The article tells the story of John Nash, a brilliant mathematician whose life changed dramatically following a car accident that left him paralyzed below the waist. As a result of his injuries, Nash became unable to walk or talk, yet he remained very intelligent and creative. Eventually, Nash developed schizophrenia, which caused him to become paranoid and delusional. In time, he lost contact with reality completely, and eventually died by suicide. I've never heard of the person named John Nash before, but I can certainly understand what happened to him. I feel myself getting agitated, and I have to ask, "What do you think? Is there anything wrong with me?"
Dr. Szozas leans forward slightly, and gives me a reassuring smile, "You know, I'm not sure if you are aware of it or not, but when we speak telepathically, I don't use any speech sounds at all; instead I communicate through images and feelings. For example, when I say something to you, I am actually communicating with the part of your brain that interprets the information I am giving to you. I can only do that because I am able to read your mind. So let's just start with the basics: Do you hear voices inside your head?"
"No," I answer, and then I add, "but I have been hearing them since I was a little girl, and they are always telling me to kill people."
He nods his understanding, and I continue, "They tell me that I am evil, that I am a monster, that I am going to go to hell and burn forever."
Szozas frowns a bit at the mention of the devil, but he remains

My name is Kaitlin Miller."
He nods thoughtfully, then looks away from me, "And why do we meet?"
"Well, um..." I say, feeling embarrassed, "It all started last week after I went online searching for information about this... uh... problem I have."
"OK, go ahead, tell me what happened."
So I start talking, telling him about how I got sucked into the web, how I felt compelled to follow links, and how I ended up reading things that were inappropriate for a young girl such as myself. As I speak, I watch his face carefully for any sign of disgust or revulsion. But there isn't one; instead his expression remains calm, even sympathetic.
When I finish speaking, I ask, "Do you think I might be sick? Should I get help?"
Dr. Szozas responds, "You certainly should seek professional help, but before we can decide whether you need medical attention or not, I'd like to hear more about your symptoms."
I nod, "OK, sure."
We spend the next half hour discussing my experiences thus far, and I describe them to him with much greater detail than I had previously. I also explain that I've been experiencing other strange phenomena too: I feel weak when I am alone, and I become very tired when I am out of contact with others. My hands shake, especially when I am writing, which makes me nervous because I don't want to drop anything I'm holding. And when I'm near people, I find that I am drawn towards them, but when I try to interact, I lose control, and I end up doing something stupid.
In addition, I mention the dreams that I sometimes experience; they are always the same, and I am afraid that I am going to hurt someone when I am dreaming. I know that I am just imagining the pain, but I still feel it anyway.
Finally I tell

My name is Stephanie Anne Smith."
He nods. "And why did you contact me?"
"Well, after reading the website for this clinic, and seeing all those testimonials about how great they are, I thought I would give them a try. I've been having trouble sleeping recently, and I was hoping maybe that they had something to offer..."
"Oh yes, I can certainly understand that," he replies, leaning back in his chair, "you have to sleep, don't you? Otherwise life becomes unbearable. But do you think there might be other reasons for your insomnia?"
I pause again, thinking about what he said. The idea that I may be suffering from depression or anxiety doesn't really register with me yet. It isn't until I hear myself saying, "No... not really. I guess I just need to get some rest."
Dr. Szozas sits forward now, and places both hands flat on the desk, "You seem to be very uncomfortable telling me things. You are afraid that I will judge you harshly, or perhaps even diagnose you with a mental illness. Am I right?"
Again I am taken aback by his perceptiveness. This is such an unusual way to start a consultation; usually one starts off with small talk to ease into the conversation. Yet somehow he is able to sense that I am uneasy with him, that I am hiding something. And I feel compelled to answer his questions honestly.
"Yes, I suppose I am a little concerned about being judged. I know that I am a good person at heart, but I'm also a mother, and I'm trying to raise a young child alone. I'm sure that I'm doing the best I can, but I worry that I'm going to screw up the kid's future if I mess up at work too much. I'm worried about her safety at home. I'm scared that she'll be hurt if I lose control. I'm afraid that

My name is Elisa Greengrass."
He nods, "And?"
"Well... I've been having strange dreams, recurring nightmares actually. They started after I saw something online."
"What did you see?"
"A video of this woman being tortured by her boyfriend, and then she killed herself. The video went viral, and I think I became obsessed with watching more videos of women being beaten or raped, or getting murdered." I shudder involuntarily at recalling those images, and I wish they would just go away.
Dr. Szozas doesn't seem surprised at all, "Go on."
"It got worse when I found another site where people were posting pictures of dead bodies, and reading their stories. It was awful stuff; murders and rapes, torture scenes, suicides..."
Dr. Szozas looks concerned now, "Elisa, what exactly do you remember about these disturbing dreams? Can you describe them?"
I try to recall the details of the dream last night: I was walking through a city street, and there was a young woman standing outside one of the buildings. She had long hair tied back in a ponytail, and wore a white blouse with black jeans. As I approached the building, I heard screaming coming from inside, and I walked up the stairs to the front door, which I opened. Inside, I saw the girl lying face up, blood pooling beneath her. Her wrists were bound together behind her, and her ankles were chained to the legs of a chair. I looked closer, and I noticed that the chains had been cut, and the girl's hands and feet were free. I watched horrified as the man who was raping the girl, a man I recognized from the internet, beat and kicked the poor girl until she died. I woke up crying.
"So you have no idea what triggered the nightmare?"
"No! I don't know if it has anything to do with the website I

My name is Samantha. I've been having problems sleeping recently."
He nods sympathetically, "And what sort of problems?"
"Well... I can't sleep. It feels like something's wrong with me, but I don't know what it is. My mind keeps racing all night long. Sometimes I wake up feeling anxious, and sometimes I feel exhausted."
"So let's start there: have you had any significant changes in your life lately? Stressors perhaps? A new job maybe? Any recent stressful events?"
"No, nothing really important. Well..." I pause for effect, "...just the death of my father last week."
Dr. Szozas raises an eyebrow, "How did this affect you?"
"It just makes me think about things differently now. How will I cope without Dad?"
"Have you ever suffered from insomnia before?"
"Never."
"Do you drink alcohol or use other drugs?"
"Not much, but I do smoke pot occasionally. Not very often though."
"You mentioned anxiety earlier; are you worried about anything right now?"
"Yes, I'm afraid that if I go back to school I'll fail out again. I haven't done well in high school so far, and I want to graduate with honors next year."
"Hmmmmm. What else?"
"What else what?"
"There are many different ways to describe symptoms such as yours; I'd like to get more information about your situation. For instance, I noticed that you mentioned anxiety; I wonder why that is, since I doubt that is a symptom that is common among people with PTSD, which is a psychological condition that is caused by experiencing a traumatic event, and the resulting fear, helplessness, and horror that follows. In addition, I also detect signs of depression; a lack of interest in activities that were once pleasurable; feelings of hopelessness; loss of appetite; fatigue; irritability;
