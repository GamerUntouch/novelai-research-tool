=== Prompt ========================================
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "

=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Amy S., and I've been experiencing... odd feelings lately."
He nods, encouragingly, "And what have you experienced?"
"Well, things seem different somehow. It feels like there’s more than one person inside of me. There's this other consciousness, separate from mine, that seems to know things that I don't want to know, but can't stop knowing them. And then sometimes it just disappears completely."
"What do you think caused all of this? Have you ever had any mental health issues before now?"
"No, never. Not until recently. I haven't even been thinking much about anything since I graduated high school, except maybe getting married or having kids someday. But I guess I should tell you about myself. My dad died when I was twelve years old, and my mom got sick soon after that. She passed away last year. I was pretty close with her, we were really tight for a while, but she wasn't able to deal with losing Dad right away. By the time she did get better, I had moved out and started college.
"After graduation I worked a few jobs, but nothing seemed to work out for me. I thought about quitting, but I didn't want to leave the only family I'd known for the past twenty-two years. I knew that if I quit I would regret it forever. I ended up taking a job with a local company that does data entry. I hated that job because I was miserable all the time. I couldn't sleep at night because I kept dreaming about being back home with Mom, but I felt trapped in the same place where I grew up, and I felt like I needed to escape to somewhere new to start again. I wanted to be free, but I couldn't figure out a way to do it. I tried dating, but I always came up empty-handed. I spent a lot of money on online

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Irene Adler."
He nods slightly, "Go ahead."
"Well... I've been experiencing strange feelings lately..."
Dr. Szozas leans forward, resting his elbows onto his knees, "Tell me more about this feeling," he prompts.
And I do. I tell him about the dreams, the fear, the sense of being watched, and the fact that I can't remember them clearly. And then I start to feel really uncomfortable talking about it all, because there is something else happening too: my heart starts racing, and I get short of breath, and I have to stop to catch my breath.
Dr. Szozas notices what I am doing, and asks if I need to pause for a moment. I nod yes, and I breathe deeply until I calm myself down again. He sits back in his chair, and looks at me intently, "You said earlier that you were not sure whether or not this was an unusual case?"
"Yes, I don't know anything about this sort of thing," I admit.
"Do you think you might be having a panic attack? Have you ever experienced one before?"
"No, never!" I answer honestly, but I am starting to doubt myself now. Is this normal? Am I just imagining things?
"I understand that you are a very busy woman with a lot going on right now, but I would appreciate it if we could meet at least once a week for at least the next month to discuss your progress. If you are willing to commit to that, I will be happy to continue our sessions. I hope that you'll be able to find the time to come back to see me regularly," he tells me with a smile.
I look at him, and I am surprised by his optimism. I say, "Of course I will! I'm sorry, I didn't realize that I had

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Emily Smith."
He nods, and asks, "What brings you to our offices?"
And then I tell him. Everything. Every little detail, even the parts that don’t seem important right now. When I finish telling him, he looks pensively at the ceiling, and then back at me.
Finally, he speaks: “So you think that your life is being controlled by a computer program? That this machine is controlling all aspects of your life?”
I nod. My mind races with thoughts, trying to figure out what he means. Why would I feel this way? How can this be true? What does he want from me?
He smiles again, kindly, reassuringly, and says, "It sounds very complicated, but I promise I'll explain it clearly to you. Can you start by describing your situation more fully for us?”
I begin, and I describe my symptoms to him; they are numerous. And I try to give him an idea of the timeline that I have been experiencing them.
After listening intently to me talk, he responds, "Emily, we do not believe that there is any such thing as a 'computer virus', or a 'malicious software'. We do know that computers are complex machines that contain thousands or millions of lines of code, and that those codes are often written by humans. But when a programmer writes the instructions to a piece of software, the programmer is only writing a small portion of the overall code. The rest of the code is created automatically when the program is run. It is the same with human beings. Our brains are complex mechanisms that create many different kinds of chemical signals that control the body. If a person is healthy, their brain will send out a signal that tells the heart to beat faster when a predator is near, or to slow down if the danger is past. If the person is sick,

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Amy."
He nods, encouragingly, "Amy...why do you think you were brought here?"
Again, I pause, trying to find the right words to say, "It’s hard to explain..."
And then he smiles again, reassuringly, "Don't worry, just tell me whatever you want to share, I'll listen."
So I try to put together what happened yesterday, and I start by explaining about the strange sensation I felt after finishing the web page, which led to my having this dream, where I saw myself holding onto the edge of a cliff while water rushed underneath me. And then I describe the feeling of being pulled away from the ledge, and falling backwards into the darkness below. The rest of the dream didn't really seem important until I described the part where I was running through a forest of trees with a pack of wolves chasing me. That was when he asked me if I had any other dreams or visions since waking up that morning.
Dr. Szozas listens intently, and asks questions now and then. At one point during our conversation, I feel compelled to ask him a question that has been bothering me: "Doctor, I've always wondered about the color of your hair. It looks dark brown, but I can't help but wonder if there's something else to it? Do you know what I'm talking about?"
He gives me a smile that tells me that I'm not the only person to have ever thought that before. "Yes, I have a natural red tint to my hair, but it's not that noticeable unless I wear bright colors, like blue jeans, or maybe navy blazers. But that's all I'm allowed to wear at work, so I don't get to show off my hair very often. I'm sorry that I'm not much help, but I hope that helps."
"Oh yes, it does," I

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Irene Adler."
He nods, "And what brings you here?"
Now this is where things get interesting. I tell him all about the web, and the strange experiences I've been having since I discovered it. He listens intently, and then asks, "So, do you believe any of this?"
Well, I know exactly what he means by that question. It's not whether or not I believe the story itself, because I can't really say if it is true or false. What does it matter? The real issue is: Does it affect me?
That's what I want to know. And I have to admit, I don't think I'd ever met anyone else before who had encountered something similar to what I'm describing. It feels very personal, and I feel like I might explode if I don't talk about it. But I also realize that there are certain aspects to the experience that I need to keep private.
Dr. Szozas responds with a thoughtful nod, "This is a complex case, and we'll need to work together to determine what it is that you're experiencing. Do you mind telling me more about the details of your situation?"
We chat for about an hour, and I tell him about the web, about the dreams I've been having, about the voices I hear when I'm awake, about the way I sometimes lose control. He writes notes on a pad, asking me questions about the nature of the visions I'm seeing, and the feelings that they evoke in me.
Finally I ask, "What happens next?"
He smiles at me, "It depends on you. If you decide that you would like to continue working with me, I will schedule a follow-up appointment to go over the results of our initial session."
I stand up, "Thank you, Dr. Szozas. I'm not sure I understand

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Rosemary Rees."
He nods, and asks, "And why did you send this email?"
"Well, um..." I begin, trying to find a way to explain myself without being too vague or leaving anything out.
"You don't have to answer if you'd rather not," he states calmly, "but please feel free to speak freely."
So I tell him about my past life, and my family, and how they died, and then I talk about the web site, and what I saw there, and all of a sudden, Dr. Szozas sits up straight in his chair, "Rosemary, do you remember when we talked about the concept of reincarnation? Do you recall our discussion?"
I shake my head yes.
"When we spoke about the possibility of you having lived before, I asked if you were certain that it wasn't just a dream or something similar. You said 'No.' And I believe you now." He pauses for effect. "That means... that means that you may very well be correct about the events which transpired last week. But I think you should know that you are not dreaming right now; you are living a true life experience. This is no game!"
I nod again, I'm still unsure about any of this. I was hoping to hear that I was simply experiencing a vivid nightmare, but I'm not sure that I want to accept the reality that I am a ghost, that I'm dead but alive at the same time. I wish I had never seen the website, but I can't undo that fact. I'm stuck with the knowledge that I'm a ghost, and I'll probably be a ghost until I die. I'm afraid to ask the next question that comes to mind: Will I ever get to go home? I hope that I will, but I'm scared to death that I won't. I've already lost

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Rebecca Ann Smith."
He nods, and leans forward intently, listening closely to my story, and then asks, "And what brings you to our clinic?"
Now this is where things get confusing for me. As I tell him, I feel myself getting more confused by the second. It feels almost as though there are two separate people inside me, one that knows what she wants, and another that doesn’t know what she wants, but just keeps doing whatever her other self does. And now they’re fighting each other, and neither will give way. The good part of me can barely contain herself, telling Dr. Szozas all about the strange occurrences I've been having since last week: waking up in the middle of the night, hearing voices talking about me, seeing visions of a web of spiders hanging above me, and being unable to sleep because I keep dreaming about them. But the bad part of me won't shut up. She starts screaming about how I should have never gone through with this stupid idea in the first place, but I don't want to listen to her anymore; she's making me crazy. I'm not sure which side is winning right now.
Dr. Szozas listens to me patiently, nodding occasionally, and asking questions about the details, "So, do you think you might be suffering from a dissociative disorder? Are you experiencing any flashbacks or nightmares?"
I nod yes to both of his questions.
"Well, I'd like to start off with a baseline assessment. Please stand up and turn to the left," he instructs me. I obey, turning to the left, and I find that I am facing a mirror; I am wearing a simple white t-shirt with a pair of black yoga pants. I look at the reflection in the mirror; I am a little surprised to see that I look pretty normal. I am about 5'3",

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Amelia Bell."
He nods, "And why did you choose this particular therapist?"
"Well, um... I've been seeing another doctor, but she's not really helping much, and I think maybe there is something wrong with her too, because she keeps talking about things that aren't real, and saying weird stuff. And I don't know what to do anymore."
Dr. Szozas leans back in his chair, his legs crossed, and smiles again. It makes me feel better just being near him, even though we have only met briefly. I continue, "She thinks I should go to a hospital or something, but I don't want to leave home."
He asks, "What's your relationship to Miss Jones? Is she your mother?"
I pause for a moment before answering, "No, actually she isn't related to me at all."
Dr. Szozas raises an eyebrow, "So then why are you seeking help from her?"
I sigh, "Because I'm afraid to be alone right now. She's always watching me. I can hear her voice when she talks to herself, but sometimes she'll talk to me too, and I get scared. I try to ignore it, but I can't. I need to figure out what is happening to me, but I don't know where else to turn to."
Dr. Szozas ponders a bit, "Is Miss Jones able to communicate with other people?"
"Yes, but I don't understand what they say. I tried to listen to them once, but I couldn't pick out any words."
"That sounds like a severe case of schizophrenia to me. I would recommend that you seek professional assistance immediately. I will schedule a consultation with the next available psychiatrist that I am aware of, but I am confident that I can handle the matter myself. I am very good at my

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Sarah Smith."
He nods, then looks back at his computer screen, and asks, "And why have you decided to seek counseling?"
"Because I can't stand being alone anymore," I answer honestly. "I've been alone too long now, and I feel like I need help dealing with this."
"How old are you? And where do you live?"
"Twenty-seven years old. My parents died when I was young, and since they left me nothing but debts, I moved out of home when I turned eighteen."
"That explains much," he smiles, nodding again, "and what brings you to our practice?"
"Well... I'm not sure if I should tell you yet..."
"Why don't we just get started by asking questions, okay?"
"Okay."
"Do you think that you might be suffering from any mental illness?"
"Yes."
"What type of symptoms are you experiencing?"
"It's hard to explain. I know things that other people don't know about me. Things that only happen to me, or things that I seem to understand better than others. It's like I have two different personalities, one that is normal, and the other is very strange."
Dr. Szozas is writing notes furiously on his legal pad, which I am watching intently. "Tell me more about the 'strange' personality."
"This is the part that I find most difficult to talk about. I am having problems with time, with memory loss, with feeling trapped, and with paranoia. I'm afraid that I'm losing my mind, that I'm going crazy. I'm worried that I will hurt myself because I cannot control my thoughts. I am also concerned that I am harming those around me with my actions. I am worried that I am a danger to society. I am scared that

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Helen Browning."
He smiles, "And what brings you to see me?"
I pause again, "Well...you know..."
"Yes, yes, I do indeed," he nods encouragingly.
"You seem very confident about this whole process," I say cautiously, trying not to sound too confrontational.
"Oh, don't worry, Miss Browning, we've all been there before. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious. You can even ask me any questions if you'd like."
"OK then, let's get started," I offer.
"Very good, now tell me what brought you here today," he requests.
So I start talking. About my sister, who is obsessed with spiders, her obsession with them, and she wants to help others like herself find solutions. But the more I talk about her, the more confused I become. She was always such a sweet girl, so smart and thoughtful, but now... Now she acts like something else entirely. Something dark and twisted. And it scares me because I have never seen anything like it before, not ever. Not since the day that my mother died. That's when I became the person that I am today. The one that I am right now. I am afraid to lose control. I am terrified that I will go crazy if I don’t regain my sanity soon. I am scared that I am losing my mind, but I am also relieved that I am finally being taken seriously. I am starting to realize that I am not just a victim anymore, that I am a survivor. I am a fighter. I am a woman that knows the truth about the world, and I am going to prove to everyone that I am a better human than they are. I am a superior human that deserves to be treated with respect. I am a better human that should be respected. I am a better human that
