My name is Ddraig." I pause for a moment, trying to decide where to start. "Well, actually, I guess I should begin by telling you about myself. My family tree goes back a long way, perhaps as far as you can imagine. We have been dragonkin since time immemorial, even before the Great War. Our bloodline stretches all the way back to the beginning of recorded history, and we've always had magical abilities, especially those related to our fire magic. But there's something different about us now..."
He nods encouragingly, and then responds, "Go ahead...tell me what you know about this condition."
So I do. I tell him about the dreams, the feeling of being watched, the strange occurrences happening around me. I tell him about my research online, about the website and the forum, and about the things I learned about other dragons suffering similar symptoms. He listens intently, taking notes, asking questions. When I finish speaking, he pauses for a few moments, just staring off into space.
Then he speaks: "What you describe sounds very much like a case of dissociative identity disorder (DID). It is also known as multiple personality syndrome or split-personality disorder. In DID, the individual suffers from two or more distinct personalities that exist simultaneously within the same body. This usually occurs following an extreme trauma, such as torture or severe abuse during childhood. The 'alters' are often referred to as the primary and secondary personae, or identities.
"In your situation, the primary persona appears to be the dominant one, which is causing the problems. As the primary persona, the dominant personality tends to be the most intelligent, logical, goal-oriented, and rational. If the secondary persona is the one that is acting out in the dream state, that would indicate that the secondary persona is the more impulsive, emotional, and less controlled side of the mind.

My name is Ddraig Krateos."
He nods, "That will do fine. Now tell me, what brings you here today?"
I begin nervously, "Well...um..." My words trail off. It feels awkward talking about myself. But I have to know, what is wrong? What does this doctor think I should do?
Dr. Szozas continues patiently, "You don't need to feel uncomfortable talking to me. You can speak freely. And if there's anything that I can help with, please let me know. I want you to understand that we'll work together to figure out exactly what is happening to you, and then we'll try our best to find a solution. We might not succeed, but I promise you that I won't give up until we've exhausted all options available to us." He smiles reassuringly at me.
It sounds good to hear, but I still feel apprehensive. I'm worried about the cost. I haven't even gotten my license yet, and I just got a car, so I'm barely making ends meet right now. How much is this going to cost? Will I ever get my license?
Dr. Szozas picks up a pen, and begins jotting notes into a notebook computer that sits on his desk, "Let's start with a few basic questions; age, marital status, children, current residence, employment history?"
I answer each question truthfully, "Age: 32 years old; Marital Status: Single; Children: No; Current Residence: San Francisco Bay Area; Employment History: I was a web designer; I freelance from home; I live alone; I am a Dragon." I pause to swallow hard, "I am a Dragoon." I say the word with a hint of sadness, and a slight sense of loss.
"A Dragoon, yes. I see; I was wondering if you had any family members that were Dragons,

My name is Ransom." I pause before continuing, feeling very uncomfortable. The words seem to catch in my throat, and I feel embarrassed by them. I don't know where they came from, but suddenly I find myself speaking in this strange new voice, "And... I'm here because..." I trail off. My mouth moves without any input from me, "...because I can't stop thinking about something terrible that happened to me, and I think there might be something wrong with me."
Dr. Szazas sits forward, leaning forward in his chair, "Ransom, what do you remember?" he asks softly, intently. He puts his elbows onto his knees, interlacing his hands together, "Do you have nightmares? Nightmares about being attacked by dragons?"
Oh god, I hope not. I swallow hard, trying to keep control of my emotions, "No, no dreams at all really. Just thoughts, mostly about the attack. Sometimes I'll dream about being underwater, and then wake up gasping for air. And sometimes I just get scared when I'm alone, even though nothing ever happens."
Dr. Szazas nods, "OK, let's start with the most recent incident: you were attacked by two drakes, correct?"
I nod, "Yes sir, one was blue, and the other was black."
He smiles gently at me, and leans back into his chair, "How did that happen?"
I clear my throat, "Well, I was flying along, and I heard a dragon call out to me, but I didn't hear his voice. It was just a hiss. I flew closer to the ground, and I saw the two dragons fighting each other, but I couldn't tell which was winning. I was too far away to help, and I was afraid to fly between the two of them. I was still confused about whether I should help or stay out of it. Then I noticed

My name is Miski." I pause briefly before continuing, "And yes, I have been experiencing problems lately... since yesterday actually..."
He nods knowingly, and I continue, "...and I came here because I don't know what else to do. There's just something wrong with me, and I can't figure out what it is." My head drops forward slightly, and I sigh heavily. This is hard stuff to admit, even though I've known it for a while now. I feel like a failure already.
Dr. Szozas smiles again, and sits back in his chair, folding his hands together. He looks directly at me, his expression serious, "Well, let's start by having you tell me exactly what happened yesterday."
So I go through the whole story: waking up after a long nap, feeling groggy, then getting really hungry, eating a sandwich, then being unable to sleep, staring at the ceiling until I heard noises coming from downstairs.
Then there was a noise outside the window, and I looked out, saw the dragon, and ran away. That part I leave out completely, but when I get to where I hid myself inside the tree house, I found that the dragon had followed me up to the top floor. It climbed up the ladder right behind me, and I jumped off the edge of the platform to escape its clutches.
Dr. Szozas is quiet as I finish my tale, but he doesn't interrupt me once. When I'm done, he stares at me for a moment, and I wait nervously for his next words.
After a few moments, I hear a soft chuckle, "You poor thing. You must be exhausted!"
I look at the doctor, confused; I thought I'd be scolded, or at least admonished. But instead I'm rewarded with a warm smile and a reassuring nod, "Yes, I'm afraid I am. I'll be honest with you

My name is Ddraig Astar." I pause again, wondering if this is the right answer. Is there another correct answer? But then, I have nothing else to lose by saying it, so I continue, "Ddraig Astar. The dragon whose egg hatched the dragons of Azlak." I stop and wait for his reaction. It doesn't seem to surprise him much; only a slight widening of those beautiful brown eyes, before they return to their original position.
"Yes, yes indeed, we can start there," he responds, nodding slightly. "Now tell me, what brings you to my office?"
So I explain about being attacked, about the web, about the strange feelings inside me, and about my desire to understand them better. About wanting to know if I'm normal, or not. And about feeling that I should seek help.
He listens intently while I speak, occasionally interjecting a question or two. When I finish speaking, he sits back in his chair, crossing one leg over the other, resting an elbow on top of his knee. His hands are clasped together in front of him, and I watch as he thinks. He looks thoughtful. "What do you think is causing all this?"
Well, I've been thinking about that myself; I'm sure I would be able to figure it out, if I knew more about psychology, but I don't. I really don't. I just want to be understood; I feel that I'm misunderstood, that I'm a freak, that I'm different. I'm scared that I might hurt somebody; I'm afraid that I'll go crazy; I'm angry that I am even having these thoughts.
Dr. Szozas leans forward a little, placing his elbows on his knees, his eyes still fixed on me, "How long has this been going on?"
I shrug a bit, and say, "Since I was a child; I

My name is Wren."
He smiles again, this time more broadly, and nods, "And why do you think you should be seeing me?"
I pause before responding, wondering if I should just tell him, because it feels too personal somehow, but then I decide against it, and continue, "Well... I've been having nightmares lately. They started when I saw those kids being tortured by the dragons. But they aren't really dreams. I wake up sweating, crying, scared, and then I have to go back to sleep, and the cycle repeats itself. It gets worse each night, and now I can't stop thinking about them."
Dr. Szozas sits forward, leaning toward me, "Wren, what do you remember about the dream? What were you dreaming about exactly?"
I answer hesitantly, "It was horrible. A dragon had captured two children, a boy and a girl, and was torturing them both with fire. The boy kept screaming, 'Help us!' while the girl pleaded, 'Mommy, help.' And then there was a loud crash, and the dragon fell to the ground dead. That's all I remember."
Dr. Szozas pauses for a moment, "Have you ever experienced anything similar? Ever heard voices or seen visions, or felt something that wasn't real?"
I shake my head slowly, "No, I haven't. No one else has either, I don't know if I'm going crazy or if I'm not crazy at all..." I trail off, unsure if I want to say anymore about the subject.
Dr. Szozas chuckles, "Don't worry, I'm not a psychiatrist. I'm a psychologist, and I'm a little concerned about you. Do you mind if I ask a few questions about you, and about your life?"
I shrug, "Sure, I guess. I'm a bit uncomfortable talking about myself though,

My name is... My name is..." I can't remember. What does one say? "Oh, um, Katarina Claes." I tell him.
He nods slowly, "And what brings you to my practice?"
"Well, actually I just had this email forwarded to me by a friend, and I thought maybe something might have been wrong with me."
"Would you mind telling me exactly where we left off before I interrupted you?"
"Uh, well, after talking to you on the phone, I decided to go ahead and visit a web page that you recommended. It was called 'Dragonology'. I think it was supposed to help people deal with their dragons."
Dr. Szozas looks surprised, "You went online to find information about dragonology?"
"Yes sir. Well, I didn't really know what to expect, but I did find a site that was very helpful."
"Hmm. And how long ago were you there?"
"Um, yesterday afternoon."
"Yesterday morning, more likely." He grins at me again, "It would seem that you are having trouble dealing with your dragon, and I will need to get a little background information about her before I begin our session. Can I ask you to describe your relationship with her, please?"
"Sure. She's a red fire drake named Liliana. I've known her since she hatched from the egg, and I helped raise her until about a year ago when I started high school. We got along great together; I was always helping her with things, I'd feed and groom her all the time, I even made a game out of training her to use magic. I felt like I knew everything about her, I loved her to pieces."
"Mmhmm, I'm sure you did. Now, I understand that you recently graduated from the Academy, is that correct?"
"Yeah, I graduated last month."

My name is Taryn, and I have been having strange thoughts lately." My voice sounds thin and weak, even to myself.
He nods, "And what kinds of 'strange thoughts' might those be?"
"Well, uh...I think I may be losing control of my mind somehow. It feels like something inside is controlling me. And then there were dreams..." I trail off.
Dr. Szozas looks at me curiously, "Do you feel like you've lost touch with reality? Do you know where you are right now? Can you describe this place to me?"
I shake my head slowly. "No, I don't know where I am, or if I am really awake. The room is very bright, but I can't see anything except blackness. There's a white noise sound that I hear all the time. When I try to focus on one thing, I lose track of everything else. Sometimes I wonder if I am dreaming, but other times, when I get up to go to the bathroom, I wake up, and I'm standing in front of the mirror with just a towel wrapped around me. What do you think?"
Dr. Szozas smiles at me again, "So let's start by getting the facts straight: How old are you, and where are you from originally?"
"I am twenty-two years old, I live in California, and I was born and raised in Oregon."
"Have you ever had any mental health issues before today?"
"Yes, I did. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder after I was fifteen. I took medication to help me cope with the stressors in my life."
"When was the last time you saw a doctor about that?"
"It was about a year ago. I haven't taken the pills since then, but I still suffer from the same symptoms. I would say that I am currently experiencing mild depression."
"Mild,

My name is Zulenna."
He nods, "And why did you send me this message?"
"Well, uhm... I've been having some trouble sleeping lately..."
"How long have you had this problem? It doesn't seem to be affecting your work very much," he observes.
"It started about two weeks ago," I say softly, "and it hasn't gotten better since then. It's just really hard to sleep at night, even though I try not to nap during the day. And when I do get to bed, I wake up feeling exhausted again soon after waking up. I can barely function without rest until morning."
"Is there anything else that would cause this sort of insomnia?"
"No, nothing that I know of," I reply, "but I'm not sure what to think about it. I feel fine otherwise, except I'm tired all the time."
Dr. Szozas studies me carefully, "Have you ever experienced any trauma or loss recently? Any major changes to your life?"
"Nothing I can recall. What does that matter anyway?" I ask myself.
"Oh, I don't know, maybe something is bothering you subconsciously, and it manifests itself through sleeplessness," he ponders.
"You may be right. Is there anything I should tell you about that might help me understand what is happening to me, other than the fact that I'm awake most of the time?" I inquire.
"Yes, I'd be happy to hear whatever you want to share with me," he replies with a smile.
So I start talking, telling him about the strange dreams I was having, about the things that were going through my mind, about the web. I explain that I was unable to find out more about the people that I was dreaming about because they weren't real; that I was only able to learn that I had a dream about a dragon by finding a website

My name is Aaliyah."
He nods, "Aaliyah...and?"
"And I have a problem," I say softly.
"Tell me more," he encourages, leaning forward, eagerness written all over his face.
So I do just that: I tell him about my dreams, the nightmares, the visions, the voices, the memories. And I tell him about the things I've been doing since then, trying to figure this out. But when I get to the part where I asked my friends if they'd heard any weird noises or seen anything strange, their reactions were mixed. Some said yes, others said no.
"What did your other friend, Taryn, say?" he asks.
"She didn't know what was happening either," I admit.
Dr. Szozas smiles, "It sounds to me like you're experiencing something very real, Aaliyah. That being said, we don't yet know if it's good or bad. It might even be both."
"How can I find out?" I ask, "If it's bad..."
"Well, let's start by getting to know each other better, shall we? Tell me about yourself, and why you think you're having these experiences."
I nod, and I begin talking about myself, telling him everything about me that I feel is relevant to the conversation. He listens intently to my story, taking notes along the way. I'm surprised to learn that he is a practicing psychiatrist himself, though I'm not sure exactly when his practice began. I also explain about the web I found about his work, and I show him the email I sent to Dr. Szozas.
"You are a fascinating woman," he tells me after I finish.
"Why is that?" I wonder.
"Because you are living an interesting life. You are a dragon with human traits. There are many people who would be jealous
