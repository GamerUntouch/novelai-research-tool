=== Prompt ========================================
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "

=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Abigail Williams." My heart begins pounding hard inside my chest, and I feel myself flush red hot. "I came because I don't know what's happening to me, and I thought maybe..." I pause, unsure whether to continue. "Maybe there's something wrong with me, and I need help."
He leans forward, "Tell me more about this problem you have. What do you think might happen?"
I tell him about the web sites I've been visiting, about being unable to sleep, about seeing things... And then I tell him about the dreams, and the strange feeling in my body when I wake up after sleeping. He listens intently, nodding along, asking questions now and again. When I finish speaking, he sits back in his chair, his face thoughtful.
"So you think you may be having some sort of psychotic break? A schizophrenic episode?"
"Yes sir, I'm not sure if that's right or not, but that sounds about right."
"Well, let me ask you a few questions: Do you hear voices? See visions?"
"No, I haven't heard any voices, but I did have a dream last night where I saw a woman get torn apart by dogs, and she was screaming at me to stop them, but I couldn't move. I woke up covered with sweat, and I felt sick afterwards."
"Hmm. Well, let me go check a couple of things. Stay seated please."
As I watch him walk out into the hall, I realize that I am trembling. I try to control myself, but I can't. I wonder what is going to happen. Will I be sent home? Or will I be locked up somewhere? I hope I won't be locked up. I am terrified to be alone with these people.
Dr. Szozas returns, carrying a small black device. "Let me show you a picture. This is a lie

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Anna Marie Laffey." I pause, feeling silly saying this stuff aloud to a stranger, "And I... uh..."
He smiles reassuringly, "It's ok, just tell me what brings you here today. Please start by telling me about yourself."
So I begin: "Well, um, I've been having trouble sleeping lately, and I can't seem to get back to sleep after waking up. It's almost impossible to doze off again. And I feel really tired all day long, even though I slept well last night."
Dr. Szozas nods along, writing notes on a yellow legal pad that rests atop a small stack of papers next to him. "Yes, yes, I understand that much already. You have insomnia, correct?"
"Yeah, I guess so."
"What triggers the problem? Do you know if there's anything else happening in your life right now that might be causing you stress or anxiety?"
"No, not really. I don't think so. But then again, maybe I should talk to a psychologist about that."
Dr. Szozas chuckles softly, "A psychiatrist would certainly be able to help with those issues, but I'd prefer to address the source of the issue before we go any further. I want to try something called hypnosis. Does that sound alright with you?"
"Sure, I'll try anything. I'm desperate to find an answer. I'm scared to death about what's going to happen to me."
"Good! Let's begin. Take a deep breath, relax, and let the tension flow out of your body. Now, I'm going to ask you to close your eyes, and to concentrate very hard on relaxing your muscles, one at a time. I'm asking you to visualize each muscle loosening up, until the entire body is relaxed. I'm going to count backwards from ten to zero, and when I reach zero

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Lizzie Mottram."
He nods thoughtfully, "And why do you think you should have this consultation?"
This is where things get interesting. My mind spins, trying to figure out what I can tell him. The more I consider, the less sure I become. It seems too personal, yet I don't know anything else. Should I mention the dreams? What if they are just normal dreams? How would telling him about them change what happens next? If I explain them to him, will I lose control again?
In the end, I decide to go ahead and say something. Perhaps there is nothing wrong with me after all...
"Well..." I begin hesitantly, "Last night I had a dream. And then today when I was online I found another one."
Dr. Szozas listens intently as I describe the events that took place last night. When I finish, he asks, "So you're saying that you experienced two separate episodes of spontaneous telekinesis, both while asleep, without any external stimuli or triggers?"
I nod slowly. He leans back in his chair, contemplating me with those inquiring hazel eyes. After a few moments he speaks, "Tell me about the second episode."
Again I recount the details of the incident with the computer. As I speak I realize that I am getting a little excited, that I am actually enjoying myself. I feel like I am doing something important, that I am helping to solve a mystery. I continue to talk, and I realize that I am describing the exact same event that I saw yesterday when I was online. I stop talking, and I look at Dr. Szozas with wide eyes, unsure of whether I should be shocked by the coincidence, or if I am simply being paranoid.
"Liz," he calls me softly, and I look up at him. His face is kind but serious. I am not sure what

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Claire Elizabeth Smith." My heart starts pounding against my chest, and I feel flushed hot all over. I know this isn't good. "And yes, I need help. Something bad happened last night..."
"Well then, let's start there," he interjects, leaning back into the chair and crossing his legs, "what exactly did happen?"
I explain what occurred, and how I felt afterwards. He listens intently, occasionally asking questions. When I finish speaking, he sits forward again, resting his elbows on his knees and clasping his hands together, "So...you say that something bad happened to you, and yet you don't want to elaborate further? Why is that?"
"Because I'm scared," I admit, "and I'm worried that if I tell anyone else about it, they'll think I've gone insane or something. They might even call the police!"
He smiles reassuringly, "Why would that bother you? You have nothing to hide; I promise you, we won't report anything unless you ask us to do so."
"But people will find out about it eventually. And I can't stop thinking about it."
Dr. Szozas nods slowly, "You're right; I understand. If I were to write about it, I'd probably get a lot more than just 'some girl had a dream.' But I also understand that you are frightened by the idea that others may not believe you. It's understandable; I'm sure that most doctors wouldn't either, especially after reading a few case studies about things that sound similar to yours. So I'm going to put myself in your place; I'll pretend that I am a doctor, and I am seeing a patient with a very strange condition. What is the first thing that I'm supposed to do when I meet with a new patient that is presenting with a bizarre symptom?"
"Ask them about their symptoms, of course! Then

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Amy Dyer."
He nods, and looks back at me. "And?"
"Well..." My mind races... What should I tell this man? I have never spoken about this before to anyone except maybe a few friends, and even then, they don't know all the details.
"Amy, what can we do for you today?"
This question caught me off guard, and I stammered, "Umm, uhhm... I've been having nightmares since last week, and there are things that happen during them. Things that seem real, but also strange. It's really starting to scare me."
Dr. Szozas nodded again, and said, "What kinds of dreams are we talking about here?"
"It starts out normal, with a dream within a dream, where I go to school, and then I get home, and start thinking about work, and I realize that something isn't right, but by the time I wake up, I'm already awake, and trying to figure out what happened. And when I try to remember the rest of the night, I feel like I was drugged somehow. But I wasn't. The next day is fine, but sometimes I still have trouble sleeping at night. I keep seeing things that aren't quite clear, or that I think I saw, but I can't be sure."
Dr. Szozas looked at me intently with those kind eyes, "Do you believe that these are memories from the past, or that you are reliving events that actually took place?"
I hesitated, "I honestly don't know. I just want to be able to sleep at night without being scared that I will wake up to find that I am dreaming. I would be grateful if you could help me with that. I am afraid that I might be losing my mind."
There is a pause as Dr. Szozas ponders my words, "Is there

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Samantha White."
He smiles again, "That's quite alright, just call me Mike."
Mike asks me questions about myself: what do I do? Where did I go to school? What brought me there today? How long have I been feeling this way? Have I ever had any mental health issues before? Has anyone else noticed anything strange about me lately? It goes on like that for about 30 minutes or more, and I answer all his questions honestly, because I trust him implicitly.
Then we get to talking about my dreams. I tell him about them, and then I ask him if they are abnormal or not. He laughs, "No, nothing wrong with dreaming about sex. In fact, that's one of the most common things people dream about. They often become sexualized by their subconscious mind, which can be very pleasurable."
We talk about other subjects too, mostly personal stuff, and I learn that he is single, living alone, and that he enjoys reading, traveling, cooking, writing poetry, playing chess, and practicing yoga. His only hobby is collecting antique firearms.
When the time comes to end our session, I feel much better than when I came in. I leave his office, promising to follow up with him next week.
As I walk out into the hallway, I hear voices coming from a nearby room. Curious, I open the door to find a young couple having a discussion with a doctor that looks to be about 50 years old. The man is a handsome older gentleman with a friendly smile and kind brown eyes, while the woman is a striking redhead with a bright, bubbly personality. She is wearing a blue dress that shows off her voluptuous body to its best advantage.
The man introduces himself to me, "Hello, I'm Dr. Michael Szozas; I've been taking care of Ms. Katheryn here, and I'm happy to say she is doing wonderfully.

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Elizabeth."
He nods, "And why did you call me?"
"Well, I've been having nightmares, bad ones..." I say.
"Nightmares? What do they consist of?"
"Um...well, um...it's hard to explain. They seem real, but there's something wrong with them, like they aren't really happening. And then sometimes I wake up screaming, or sweating profusely, and I have trouble breathing. It feels like I can't get enough air, even though I know I just slept. The last one happened this morning, while I was sleeping. That's why I called you, because I thought maybe I had asthma or something, but now I'm not sure what's causing all this."
Dr. Szozas sits back, contemplating me, taking notes perhaps. "Alright, let's start with the dreams, then we'll talk about the rest of it later. Tell me, when were you born?"
"November 20th, 1980, 11:30pm." I answer.
"OK, so tell me about the dream that woke you up this morning, please." I begin to speak about my nightmare, telling him exactly what was said, word by word. He listens intently, asking questions occasionally.
After I finish speaking, he asks, "Did anything else happen that day, any other events that might be related to the dream?"
"No, nothing that I can think of." I reply.
"So the only thing that was different was the dream itself, right?"
"Yes."
"Do you remember the content of the dream, anything about it that stands out to you?"
"It was a very vivid dream, but I don't remember much about the details, I was too tired to focus on the finer points."
"Anything about the setting that stood out to you?"
"The location was a big house with white walls,

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Marybeth."
He nods, and then looks away for a moment before returning his gaze back to mine, "And?"
"Well... I have this problem where I can't sleep anymore..."
"Have you been sleeping well lately? How long has this issue been happening?"
"Um... not really. It started maybe six months ago. My dreams get weird, and I wake up feeling tired all day, and sometimes I just don't want to go to bed. And then sometimes I'll wake up in the middle of the night and feel like I've got to pee or something."
"So, what do you think is causing these issues?"
"I don't know. Maybe it's stress? Or maybe there's a medical condition involved?"
Dr. Szozas pondered for a few moments, "Alright, let's start with a physical exam. I will need to draw blood samples, which I would prefer if we did not wait until Monday morning. Can you give me a urine sample right now?"
I'm taken aback by his directness, "Yes sir."
We head to the bathroom, and I stand beside him while he collects the specimen from me. He watches me closely throughout the process, observing my behavior, my demeanor. He asks questions about myself, about my family history. He checks my pulse rate, height, weight. He hands me the cup to put the results into his machine.
After the examination is done, he returns to his chair, and I return to the couch to resume our conversation.
"So, any other symptoms, besides insomnia?"
"Yeah, I guess. I'm getting a little nauseous at times, and I feel dizzy when I eat too much sugar. I also seem to be having a hard time concentrating lately, although I haven't noticed that to be a problem before today. I just thought it was because I had to work so many hours at

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Amelia."
He nods, "And why are you here?"
"Well... I've been having dreams lately..." I start, feeling slightly embarrassed by this admission, "and I don't know what they mean."
"What do you dream about?" he asks, "Tell me more about them."
So I tell him all about my dreams: how the blackness swallows me whole, and I wake up gasping for air; how I feel like something dark is trying to get inside of me, pushing its way through my insides until it gets to my heart; how sometimes there are people in the darkness, and I can hear their voices calling out to me; how I have flashes of things I shouldn't remember, or should I say, things I never want to forget; and then I try to explain what I think those nightmares might signify.
Dr. Szozas listens intently, nodding occasionally as I speak. "Amelia," he says after a moment, "do you believe that the source of these dreams is psychological? Do you think that perhaps the cause lies within your own mind?"
I shrug, "I guess I'm not sure yet. It's hard to tell. I just keep dreaming about the same stuff, and I have no idea what that means."
"Hmm..." He ponders, "Let me ask you a question, if I may. Have you ever had any unusual experiences, anything out of the ordinary, that would indicate to you that the source of the problem is external to the individual? Anything that was beyond the realm of normalcy?"
I shake my head, "No, nothing like that. I haven't done anything that seemed out of the norm, I swear. I was raised pretty much the same as everyone else; I went to school, got a job, dated boys and girls. Nothing unusual at all."
"Have you tried therapy before, Amelia?"
"Yes,

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Kelly Anne." And then I pause, wondering what else should I tell this doctor? It feels odd to say all this stuff to another person. But I feel compelled to do so... I don't know what happened to me today, but something did happen, and I've been having trouble sleeping since.
He nods, and continues, "And why have you chosen to seek professional help?" The question sounds casual enough, but there is an edge to it. I can sense that he wants answers. Maybe I shouldn't give them.
But I answer anyway, "Because I think I may be losing control of myself."
A few seconds go by, before Dr. Szozas responds, "Tell me more about what is happening."
So I describe my day: my encounter with the strange man, the web page I found, and how I had begun reading the words on the screen, until I couldn't stop. How I'd felt so drawn to the words, almost hypnotized. "It was like a drug", I explain, "and I just kept reading and reading..."
"What were you doing while you read the words?", he asks. He looks curious, but not alarmed. His expression tells me that he already knows the answer to that.
"Nothing much really," I reply. I remember the feeling of wanting to sleep, but I hadn't done that yet; I had spent most of the afternoon watching the TV, eating lunch, and now I was sitting in his office.
Dr. Szozas is nodding along with me, apparently satisfied with my explanation. I wonder if I'm going to be OK.
"Did anything unusual happen to you after you read the text?", he asks.
"No, nothing that I recall", I lie. I'm starting to worry that I'll be labeled crazy if I admit to any weird behavior. I glance at the door to the outer office.
Dr. Szoz
