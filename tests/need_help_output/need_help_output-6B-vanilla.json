I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded.

State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

He wants to know all sorts of details about me, which makes sense because I don't want to tell anyone anything unless they ask me directly. And since I've never been anywhere else except the city before, there isn't much I can say without being asked more questions.

You seem rather... withdrawn. Do you understand what I'm trying to say?\"\n\"Yes sir,\" I reply slowly, not knowing exactly what he means by that.\n\"Good girl,\" he smiles again, his dimples coming out briefly.

There are other factors that are contributing to your overall unhappiness, but those are secondary to your mental state at present.

Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Stephanie... Stephanie Miller.\"\nHe nods, and then asks, \"And what do you want?\"\nI pause again, wondering if this was a mistake? Should I have called another doctor? But then I think: Why would anyone else know more than Dr. Szozas? This guy might just be able to figure things out. So I decide to tell him all about myself. It feels good to get off my chest. My story starts with my mother dying when I was very young, and her passing left me feeling lost and alone. I spent most of my childhood wandering aimlessly through life, until finally I ended up in college where I met Brian. We fell in love, and we got married shortly after graduation. We had our daughter together, and she was born healthy and happy. She's now eight years old, and she loves playing outside with her friends. Our marriage hasn't been perfect, but it's still going strong, and I feel blessed to have found such happiness.\nDr. Szozas listens intently to my tale, nodding occasionally, and asking questions when I falter or seem unsure. When I finish, he stands up from his chair, walks back across his office to me, and pulls out one of two chairs that face each other at the end of the couch. He sits down, and smiles at me. He looks into my eyes, and says, \"So, what does that say about you, Stephanie?\"\nI sigh, realizing that I've opened myself up to an interrogation by Dr. Szozas, and that there's no turning back. So I answer honestly, \"Well, I'm not sure.  I guess that means that I'm normal, right?  Or maybe that I'm abnormal.  I don't really know.  I wish that I did.  I'd like to be confident about that, but I'm afraid that I'll find that I'm wrong. ",
