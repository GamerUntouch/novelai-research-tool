  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

A Russian name?\"\r\nI nod back, \"Yes.\"\r\nHe grins again, \"That makes sense, given where we live now. And why are you here today?\"\r\nAgain, I pause before answering, \"Well, I've been having trouble sleeping lately...\"\r\nDr. Szozas interrupts me by saying, \"Tell me more.\"\r\nSo I continue, \"It started two weeks ago, after I got home from work. It was late, I'd had a long day... I lay awake all night, tossing and turning, unable to get any sleep. I tried reading, watching TV, even listening to music, nothing worked. Finally, I gave up trying to stay asleep, and instead went downstairs to the kitchen to make myself something to eat. That's when I found this note taped to the fridge door: 'Dear Lena, if you want to talk, come upstairs.' I didn't know what to do; I was still half-dressed, and there were dishes piled up in the sink. So I just grabbed my keys and headed out the front door. When I got to the top of the stairs, I saw her standing at the bottom of them, dressed only in a bathrobe. She looked at me, and said, \"Come on up; I have some things to show you.'\"\r\nDr. Szozas laughs, \"Wow! You really are the subject of one of his stories!\"\r\nI laugh too, \"Yeah, I guess I am.\" I look at the man sitting across the desk from me, and I say, \"But that doesn't explain anything; I don't understand why I'm seeing a psychiatrist.\"\r\nDr. Szozas raises an eyebrow, \"Have you ever seen a psychologist or counselor?\"\r\n\"No, I haven",

I became pregnant...\"\r\nHe leans forward, and listens intently to my story, nodding occasionally, asking questions, adding commentary. He keeps his hands clasped together, resting them on top of one another, leaning slightly toward me. I can sense his excitement and curiosity at learning about my problem.\r\nAfter I finish telling my tale, he sits back, and looks at me thoughtfully. \"Do you recall any sexual contact between yourself and the father of your child?\" he asks.\r\nNow that is a loaded question. I try to remember the exact sequence of events that led to me getting knocked up by John Henry Jones III. I was a junior at a small private high school in a rural town in Ohio. I was a cheerleader during the football season, and I was dating a cute guy named Kevin Johnson. We were both seniors, and we'd known each other since middle school. I was the class president, and I was the most popular girl at our school. I was also the star quarterback's girlfriend, which caused some jealousy among the rest of the team.\r\nOne day I was at the mall with Kevin, shopping with my mom while Dad went to work. I",

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Jane Smith.\"\r\nHe nods, then asks, \"And where do you live?\"\r\nI answer, \"Toronto.\"\r\n\"Do you have any family there?\"\r\n\"No, none left.\"\r\nHe pauses, thinking, \"Tell me more about what brought you here today...\"\r\nI continue, telling him all about my life since I graduated high school, and my struggles with depression. He listens intently, asking questions along the way, always probing deeper to understand my situation better. When I've finished talking, he sighs, \"So let me get this straight...you want help because you think something might be wrong with you? You don't know exactly what it is, but you just feel lost somehow. And you want to find out if anything can be done about it?\"\r\nI nod, \"Yes.\"\r\n\"Well, I'll tell you right now, I don't think much of that idea,\" he replies. \"I'd say your case is one of the most complex I've ever seen. I'm not sure if we should even bother trying to figure out what it is that's causing the problem, but whatever it is, it isn't normal. That said, I will try to help you anyway. I'll need to ask you some very personal things about your history, but I promise I won't judge you or put you off by saying 'oh yeah, I remember that'. I also need to ask about your sexual history, but I assure you that I am a professional, and I am well aware that the answers I receive may be uncomfortable for both of us to hear.\"\r\nThis was news to me; I had never been asked such intimate details before. I nodded slowly, unsure of what to expect. I was already nervous about the fact that I would be sitting alone with a man, but I was also excited to see how far I could push the boundaries with him.\r",

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases, such as mine.\"\r\nDr. Szozas smiles gently, \"Yes, that sounds right. And what sort of unusual case would that be? Tell me more about it,\" he requests.\r\nSo I tell him all about my symptoms: anxiety, fear, panic attacks, insomnia, depression, nightmares, suicidal thoughts, and self-loathing. He listens intently, asking questions where appropriate, nodding occasionally while he thinks. At one point he leans back in his chair, rubbing his chin thoughtfully, \"It's interesting that you mention suicide attempts, because many people don't realize that there are different types of attempted suicides. For example, the most common type is an overdose or taking too much medication. But other times it may be a methodical plan that involves using a gun or knife to kill oneself. In those cases, they can often be stopped by calling 911 before anything happens.\"\r\nI ask, \"Is that something that I should do?\"\r\nDr. Szozas responds, \"No, not necessarily. The important thing is that we know what happened, and that the person is safe now. It is possible that the attempt was a cry for help, a way to get attention without causing permanent harm to the patient. Sometimes the best course is to just let the situation play out naturally, and hope that the individual will seek treatment on their own. There are also situations when the family is involved, and the situation becomes a legal matter that needs to be dealt with appropriately. This is rare, but not unheard of.\"\r\nI nod, and say, \"Thank you. I'll be sure to talk with the police and the hospital if I need to",
