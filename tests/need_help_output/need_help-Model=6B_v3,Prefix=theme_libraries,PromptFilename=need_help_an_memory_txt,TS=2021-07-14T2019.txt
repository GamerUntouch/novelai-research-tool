=== Prompt ========================================
I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.

[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "


=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Irene Winters. My therapist will probably ask about my childhood, but I don't know where to start..."
He smiles again, "That's fine Irene, just tell me what brings you here."
So I do. And I tell him all about my problems, and I admit that I've been masturbating too much lately, and I feel guilty because I have been thinking about sex all day long.
"I understand. You seem very worried. Are you concerned that you may become impotent? Or perhaps there is something else?"
I shake my head, "No...it's not that I can't get hard anymore, it's more like I want to cum a lot, but then I stop myself before I even get close. It feels bad when I jerk off and I try to hold back, and I end up coming a few times before I finally give up and let go. But I don't think I'm losing my erection; I still climax pretty easily when I touch my penis. I haven't had an orgasm in a while though."
Dr. Szozas looks at his watch and taps his pen on his desk, "I'll need to speak to you in a little bit, but for now, I'd like to discuss a few things with you first, if you would. Would you mind if I asked a couple questions?"
I nod, "Sure, I guess. I'm a bit nervous about this, but I trust you."
Dr. Szozas asks a series of questions regarding my history and upbringing, and I answer them honestly. I don't really lie, I just leave out the parts I find embarrassing or uncomfortable. He writes a few notes on his legal pad, asking me to clarify a point when necessary.
I'm surprised when Dr. Szozas stands up, and he walks over to a cabinet in the corner of his office. He opens it, and pulls out a

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Irene Winters, and I'm coming to you because I think something might be wrong with me."
He looks back at me, then nods, "So tell me about this 'something'."
I feel myself flush red, and I continue, "Well, I've been feeling really weird lately, and I don't know what's happening, but I have a lot of anxiety issues right now, and I don't want to go home tonight without knowing if I need help."
Dr. Szozas smiles again, and leans forward, placing both hands on his knees, "Tell me more."
I do just that, telling him everything that I can remember, from the beginning. The part where I started having those dreams, and the nightmares. How they were getting worse, and I was scared. I was worried that I was losing my mind. I felt helpless and hopeless, and I had a hard time sleeping, and I didn't eat much. I was very stressed out, and I was thinking too much.
I explained to him, "I thought I was going crazy, and I was afraid I was losing my grip on reality. I was thinking I was crazy. It was awful, and I was desperate. I wanted to get better, and I was terrified. I was frightened, and I was depressed. I was so confused. I was crying a lot, and I was trying to hide it, and I was embarrassed, and I was ashamed. I tried to deal, I did the best I could, I was working on it, but I was still struggling. I couldn't sleep, I was tired all the time, and I was hurting inside. I hated my life, and I was miserable. I was lonely, and isolated, and alone, and I needed help.
I told him, "It's a mess. I don't understand it, I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad. I

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Irene Adler."
He looks up at me, surprised by this answer.  "That's not your real name?" he asks.
"No, it isn't," I reply.
"Well then, what should we call you? You don't want to tell us your real name, but you can give us a fake one, right? A pseudonym, or something similar?"
I smile, "Yes, I suppose I can do that. My given name is actually Irina, but since I've chosen to use 'Adler' instead of 'Irwin,' and because my father chose the same surname, I guess that makes sense. It also means 'lion.' But I prefer to think of myself as a lioness."
Dr. Szozas smiles, "You know, I would never have guessed that. How did you get such a unique last name, anyway? I always thought it was a common enough name, even in the United States. What was your family's background before they moved to America?"
I shrug, "I honestly don't remember much about my parents. I was raised in Russia; I was only three years old when my mother died, and my father took me away from there shortly thereafter. I spent my childhood living in various orphanages and foster homes until I was ten or eleven when I was adopted by my uncle and aunt. I didn't really meet my biological relatives again until I was eighteen and came back for a visit to the country where I'd been born. I hadn't seen my grandparents or my cousins in over twenty-five years at that point, and I barely knew them. 
"I had a pretty normal life, and I grew up to be a fairly typical Russian girl. I studied hard, got good grades, and went on to college at the University of Moscow. I was a very shy person, and I wasn't particularly popular with my peers; I tended to

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Claire Elizabeth Baker, and I've been experiencing strange occurrences since the beginning of this year."   I pause, unsure what else to say, but Dr. Szozas just nods encouragingly, waiting patiently for me to continue.   My brain starts working overtime trying to figure out exactly what I should tell him about myself. I don't want to give away too much information, yet I also need to convey enough details to convince him that I have a legitimate problem. I decide to start by describing the events that led up to the current situation, "You can call me Lizzy for short."
He smiles at me, and leans back in his chair, resting his elbows on the arms. "OK then, go ahead, Liz."
I begin telling him the story of my life thus far, starting at the end when I was in college. I was in a relationship with a girl named Tiffany, whom I met at a party. We were both very outgoing people, and we had a lot in common, including a mutual interest in music and art.
We dated for a couple months, and I was happy. I was in a good place, and I was excited for the future; I wanted to move in together, and get married.
But the more time I spent with her, the less I liked her. I started to notice small things, little habits and mannerisms, things she said or did, and I became increasingly uncomfortable. I found myself getting angry at her, and I would yell at her for no reason. I couldn't understand why I was acting the way I was, or even worse, I didn't know I was doing anything wrong!
Things got progressively worse between us, and I broke up with her. I thought it might be a mistake, but I needed to do something to stop my behavior before it went any further. So I sought out therapy. I made an appointment with Dr. Szozas,

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Irene Molloy, and I am seeking treatment for depression." 
He nods, "That makes sense, yes. And what brings you here today?" 
"It's complicated, but I'll try to keep this brief." I say, "Last week I had sex with a woman named Lillian, and she gave birth to a baby girl. The child was born healthy and normal, and I have been caring for her ever since. She's called Maeve, and I've taken care of her for about three weeks now. This morning, I woke up, and discovered that the child was missing. I searched the house, and couldn't find her anywhere. When I asked Lillian where they were, she just looked at me blankly, and said 'they're gone.' I don't know if something bad happened to them or what, but I need to get my daughter back. I need help!"
Dr. Szozas sits quietly for a moment, and then asks, "What do you think caused the disappearance? Was there anything unusual happening in the days leading up to the incident? Did the child cry out, or did anyone hear a strange sound or a voice, perhaps a voice calling for help or a voice speaking in a foreign language, or a voice that sounded familiar to you?"
I shake my head, "No, nothing out of the ordinary. I didn't even realize what I'd heard until I went downstairs to check on the little one, and I saw the empty crib. It wasn't until I got into bed tonight that I realized I hadn't seen the kid all day. I'm scared, and I need to get my daughter back!"
Dr. Szozas listens intently, and after a few moments, he speaks up, "I understand. Let's go through the events that led up to your finding the child missing, shall we?"
I nod, and start at the beginning,

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Irene Adler."   My heart pounds a little faster than normal, and I feel a bit more relaxed now that we've begun our session. The doctor asks again, "And why are you here?"
"Um..." I stutter, "Well... I don't know where to start."  I pause for a moment, trying to think about what to say. "I guess I just want help figuring out whether or not I should get back together with my boyfriend, or if I can move past this whole situation. I haven't talked to anyone else since I broke up with him, and I really need to figure out what I want to do next."
Dr. Szozas nods, "OK, good. Let's begin by talking a bit about your ex-boyfriend, and then I'll ask a few questions about yourself, and the relationship between the two of you. Would that be alright?"
"Sure!" I reply.
I tell the doctor all about my breakup with Brian, and how I tried to talk myself out of being hurt. But I couldn't convince myself that I was in the right, and I ended up crying for hours, and not sleeping well. I also told the doctor that I had been feeling lonely, and that I was craving the attention and affection I used to receive from my boyfriend.
After I finished my story, the doctor asked, "What did you hope to accomplish when you decided to break up with him? What were the benefits to breaking up, and the drawbacks to staying in the relationship?"
I thought for a minute before responding, "I wanted to be free, but I didn't want to lose the friendship I'd built up with him. I was afraid that I wouldn't have any friends, and I would end up alone, and I wasn't sure I could handle the loneliness. And I knew that I still loved him, even though I was upset. I felt like

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Irene Adler, and I've been seeing a therapist named Michael Szozas about an issue that I have."
He smiles, "And what issue might that be?"
I pause again, then answer, "I don't know...it's hard to explain..."
Dr. Szozas nods, "That can be difficult sometimes." He leans back in the chair, and rests his hands atop his knee, "So tell me, Ms. Adler, what do you think is bothering you? What exactly are the issues that you feel compelled to discuss with this counselor?"
I lean forward on the couch, and I begin to speak. My voice is quiet, but steady. "I'm having trouble sleeping. I wake up in the middle of the night, unable to get to sleep. And I toss and turn, and I find myself waking up in the morning feeling exhausted, even though I went to bed early. I can barely keep my eyes open when I go to work. I start to question my sanity when I try to focus on my job, and I'm constantly distracted by the urge to just curl up on the floor and cry. I want to scream at the top of my lungs, 'I hate my life!' and yet I can't seem to muster up the courage to say those words out loud. I'm afraid to ask anyone for help because I'm terrified they'll laugh at me or dismiss my concerns. I wish I had the guts to admit my true feelings out loud, but I fear the consequences. I'm scared to let my guard down and reveal my vulnerability. I'm scared that my secret will somehow come out, and I'll lose everything. I'm scared to trust anyone enough to share my problems with them, and I'm scared to have no one at all. I'm frightened of the future, and I'm not sure if I can handle living in a world where everyone else is happy, and I'm

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Irene D. Carter. I am twenty years old, single, and have been having problems since high school.  My mother died two years ago, after battling cancer, and she left all her money to me. My father also passed away about five months before mom did, leaving me nothing but debts and taxes. I live off my trust fund, which is enough to cover my living expenses, but I can't seem to find any work. I've tried a few things, but none of them have worked out."
He listens intently while I tell him my story, nodding occasionally to indicate that he understands. I continue, "I don't know what is wrong with me. It feels like there's something missing inside of me. I feel empty and alone. I wish I knew what was causing this, because I think I might be suffering from depression or something similar. I haven't slept well for weeks now, and I keep thinking about suicide. I want to die, but I just cannot do it. I've thought about killing myself many times, and I even wrote a note explaining exactly what I was going to do, and I hid the letter in my room. But I never got the chance to follow through. I had a lot of friends, and I couldn't bear the thought of losing anyone else. I didn't want to hurt them, and I wanted to spare their lives the pain I was feeling.
So I decided to get help instead. I went online, and found a psychiatrist named Dr. Michael Szozas. I emailed him, and I made an appointment for Monday. I was hoping to talk to him, maybe ask for some advice, or a prescription, whatever I needed to make my life better again.
I really hope I'm not making a mistake, and I pray for guidance. I don't want to lose my mind, I just need some answers. I'm scared, and I just need to hear someone

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Irene Kelly."
He nods, encouragingly, and then asks, "And what brings you here?"
"Well, um..." I begin, and I feel myself blush, embarrassed by what I'm about to say. My heart begins beating faster. I clear my throat, nervously, "I have been feeling really weird lately, and I don't know if this is normal... I can't sleep very well at night, and I've had nightmares recently, where I dream about people being killed, and... I think they might be coming true. It makes me afraid to go outside, because there are always strangers around, and I start thinking that maybe they want to kill me, too. And I just felt like something was wrong, but I didn't know what it was, or how to deal with it, and I thought I'd better come in for help. But I couldn't tell anyone, I'm not sure if I should even talk about this, or if I should wait until I'm a little more sure of things, or if I'm crazy, or if I need to seek professional help, or if I'm imagining all of this, or if I need a shrink or a psychologist or a counselor or a psychiatrist or a therapist or a psychiatrist or a counselor or a counselor or a doctor or a doctor or a psychiatrist or a counselor or a counselor or a doctor or a doctor or a psychiatrist or a counselor or a psychiatrist or a counselor or a counselor or a doctor or a doctor or a counselor or a counselor or a doctor or a doctor or a counselor or a counselor or a doctor or a doctor or a counselor or a counselor or a doctor or a doctor or a counselor or a counselor or a doctor or a doctor or a counselor or a counselor or a doctor or a counselor or a counselor or a doctor or a doctor or a counselor or a counselor or a doctor or a counselor or a counselor or a doctor or a doctor or a counselor

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Irene Winters, and I've been having trouble sleeping lately."
He nods, and smiles again, "Yes, let's get right to business. Tell me about this problem?"
So I tell him, and he listens intently as I describe what I've experienced. And then we talk more, and I learn more about him, and about his work. It turns out that he specializes in treating people suffering from sleep disorders, insomnia, and other similar issues. 
Then he asks, "Have you tried any medications? Have you had any recent life changes or stressful events?" I shake my head 'no'.
After a few minutes, he stands up and begins walking back to his chair. He sits down and looks at me, "Well, I think that you have a serious condition, but I can't diagnose without examining you. I'll need to run a couple tests on you, and I'd like to do a little testing while I'm at it. Can I trust you not to move during the exam?"
I nod my head.
He continues, "I need to ask a lot of personal questions, but I promise I won't use the results against you. If I find anything unusual, I will contact the appropriate authorities, and they may request further information. But I don't want to scare you, I just need a bit of help. So I need to know if I can trust you, and if I can, I'm going to proceed. Do you understand?"
I feel a bit nervous, but I also feel reassured by his presence and his smile. I nod my head.
"Good girl. Now, I'm not a doctor, and I'm certainly not a psychologist. I am a psychiatrist though, and I specialize in unusual cases like yours. I'm trained to be sensitive to subtle clues and cues. I'm very good at reading nonverbal behavior; I can tell if a person is lying simply
