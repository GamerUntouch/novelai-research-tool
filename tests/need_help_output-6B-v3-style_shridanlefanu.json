Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

We've been together since high school, we were friends before then. It was a whirlwind romance. I don't know if I can say 'love', because there wasn't any time for anything else. But I do believe we had feelings for each other, even though it seemed crazy to think that way about a boy you'd known forever. And it worked out great, right? Not really...not yet anyway.\nMark was always very attentive and affectionate toward me, but I just felt invisible sometimes. He didn't talk much about himself or what he did during the day, except that he was working hard to support us. In fact, I found myself doing most of the talking. There were times when I would ask him questions about where he was from or what he liked to do, but he never gave me many details. If I wanted something done, I usually asked him if he thought it was a good idea, and he would agree without question. Sometimes I would try to get more information out of him by asking about his hobbies or interests, but that usually resulted in a \"what?\" followed by an awkward pause while I tried to figure out what I should be saying next.\nWhen I asked him about our wedding plans, I remember him looking at me and smiling. \"We'll have to wait until things settle down,\" he said. \"Things are still pretty chaotic at work. I'm trying to find a new job now that I'm unemployed, but I'm having trouble finding a position that will give me enough to live comfortably. I need to save up some money first, and I'm not sure how long that will take.\"\nAt first I was happy that he seemed to be taking his marriage responsibilities seriously. I mean, I knew that he",
