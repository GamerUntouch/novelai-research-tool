  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

They were vivid and disturbing. It felt real enough that I woke up this morning thinking I had actually done those things. And then I saw the web page on dreams, and I thought maybe they might be related to my problem.\"\nHe leans forward, \"What kinds of dreams did you experience? Tell me all about them.\"\nSo I tell him about the nightmare, and what happened after waking up. When I finish telling him about the dream, he asks me if there was anything unusual about the way I awoke, or anything different than usual before bedtime. I shake my head no, nothing like that, and I don't think I was dreaming much more than normal before I went to sleep.\nThen he tells me that he thinks I'm experiencing a phenomenon called 'dream recall'. This happens when people remember their dreams without being fully awake. Some people can go into REM sleep (rapid eye movement) while still asleep, and many times will have lucid dreams. Lucidity is the ability to recognize that one is dreaming, but not to control the events within the dream.\nDr. Szozas explains that the dream state is often associated with heightened sensory perception, increased imagination, and sometimes hallucinations. I ask him what that means, and he says that it's not uncommon for a person to hallucinate sounds, smells, tastes, even touch sensations during the dream state.\nHe continues to explain that a common occurrence is the feeling that something is trying to get inside the body, usually the throat, nose, mouth, ear, vagina, penis, etc...\nI feel a bit queasy, \"Do you know of any other cases that fit the same description?\"\nDr",

    " have you here today?\"\n\"Well, I've been having nightmares since last night. They were vivid and disturbing. It felt real enough that I woke up this morning thinking I had actually done those",
    " things. And then I saw the web page on dreams, and I thought maybe they might be related to my problem.\"\nHe leans forward, \"What kinds of dreams did you experience? Tell me",
    " all about them.\"\nSo I tell him about the nightmare, and what happened after waking up. When I finish telling him about the dream, he asks me if there was anything unusual about the way",
    " I awoke, or anything different than usual before bedtime. I shake my head no, nothing like that, and I don't think I was dreaming much more than normal before I went to sleep.",
    "\nThen he tells me that he thinks I'm experiencing a phenomenon called 'dream recall'. This happens when people remember their dreams without being fully awake. Some people can go into REM sleep (rapid",
    " eye movement) while still asleep, and many times will have lucid dreams. Lucidity is the ability to recognize that one is dreaming, but not to control the events within the dream.\nDr.",
    " Szozas explains that the dream state is often associated with heightened sensory perception, increased imagination, and sometimes hallucinations. I ask him what that means, and he says that it's not uncommon for a",
    " person to hallucinate sounds, smells, tastes, even touch sensations during the dream state.\nHe continues to explain that a common occurrence is the feeling that something is trying to get inside the body,",
    " usually the throat, nose, mouth, ear, vagina, penis, etc...\nI feel a bit queasy, \"Do you know of any other cases that fit the same description?\"\nDr"

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

It felt like I was dreaming, but I knew that wasn't really happening. The only difference between them was that each one ended differently. In one dream, I was falling asleep, and then suddenly I woke up, and I was awake, but I couldn't move. In another one, I was walking through a forest, and I heard something crying nearby. And in yet another one, I saw this woman running away from a car that was chasing her. She ran right past me without even noticing me.\"\nDr. Szozas looks pensively at me, \"Have you ever had any similar experiences?\"\nI shake my head emphatically, \"No, not at all. I don't think I'm crazy or anything, but it just feels like something is wrong with me.\"\n\"Do you know what triggered the dreams?\" He asks, leaning forward.\n\"Not at all. They just seemed to happen randomly. I didn't have a stressful day, I was sleeping soundly, and I was never sexually aroused. I'd wake up with a headache, but I feel fine now, so I guess I must be okay.\"\nDr. Szozas stands up, and walks to a cabinet, retrieving a bottle of water and a glass.

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

I have never been this unsure of myself before. My head spins as I try to figure out where to begin.  Should I tell him about the dreams? Or should I just ask him questions? What if he thinks I'm crazy?\nDr. Szozas listens patiently while I struggle to find words. Finally, after several minutes, I get my thoughts together enough to speak again, \"Um, I've had recurring nightmares since last night. They're always the same: there's a dark room, and I'm trapped inside, unable to escape. There are monsters chasing me, trying to kill me. And they will succeed if I don't do anything. But I can't remember what to do to stop them. It feels like time is running out, and I'll die because I didn't do anything.\"\nDr. Szozas pauses for a moment, but only momentarily; I sense that he is listening intently to me. He asks quietly, \"Do you think you are dying?\"\nI shake my head, \"No, not really; I guess I feel scared, but not afraid. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or not. I don't even know how I'm able to recall the dream. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing, or what the monster is, but I'm pretty sure I'm not supposed to be dead. I'm also worried that I won't be able to wake up when the nightmare ends.\"\nAfter a few more moments of silence, Dr. Szozas speaks, his voice low, almost a whisper, \"You said that the first dream started when you were watching television late at night.

Maybe I should go home and forget about ever coming here.\nDr. Szozas sits back in his chair, and looks directly at me, \"Tell me about yourself, Rebecca.\"\nSo I tell him everything: my childhood growing up with an abusive father, my mother dying when I was twelve, living alone since then with only a few friends, the job I got at the hospital, my life today. He listens attentively, nodding occasionally, asking questions that help clarify parts of my story.\nWhen I finish telling him about the web, I ask hesitantly, \"Do you know what that is, Doctor?\"\nHe smiles at me, a little sadly, \"No, I can't help you with that one. I haven't seen it yet myself; I'm still working through the backlog of cases I've been dealing with.\"\nWell that's reassuring, I guess.\nAfter a while, I realize that I am getting sleepy; I had hoped that the meeting would last longer, but I must admit that I am very tired. I yawn, and I am about to stand to leave, but Dr. Szozas stops me with a gentle hand on my shoulder.\n\"",
