   "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
   "result": "My name is Maria Elena Vargas, and I'm here because I have a problem.\"\nHe nods, \"OK, Maria Elena, let's get right to it. What exactly is bothering you?\"\nI tilt my head, \"Well, I guess I'll start by telling you what I don't understand. I've been married for almost two years now, and I just can't seem to get along with my husband. We've been married for six years, and we've never had any problems before this. It's just that lately there's been something different about him. He's always been very attentive, and loving, but lately he's been distant, even hostile. He doesn't want to talk to me anymore, and he acts really weird whenever I try to bring up anything serious. He won't even look at me when I do...and then he gets all mad if I touch him inappropriately.\"\nDr. Szozo looks at me, \"And did you ever feel that he was being unfaithful to you?\"\nI shake my head, \"No, not at all. I've never felt anything like that. He's never done anything like that before either. He's always been faithful to me, and I know he would never do anything wrong. I'm worried about him, and I thought maybe you could help me figure out what's going on.\"\nDr. Szzo thinks for a moment, \"Maria Elena, I think I can help you with that. I believe I can tell you what's going on with your husband. You said that he acted strange recently, and that he didn't want to talk to you? Have you noticed any changes in his behavior since that time?\"\nI nod, \"Yeah, he started acting really weird after the Christmas party. He'd act really distant, and he wouldn't look at me or talk to me at all. He only talked to me during the day, and he hardly ever spoke to",

How old are you?\"\nI nod, \"I'm 22 years old.\"\nHe nods, \"That's quite young. What do you do for a living?\"\nI pause, and try to think of something to say, \"I'm a waitress at the local diner.\"\nHe nods, \"How long have you been working there?\"\nI pause, and then tell him, \"Since last summer.\"\nHe nods, \"And what brings you to this particular establishment?\"\nI pause, and then tell him, \"I don't know. I just feel like I've lost control of myself lately. I used to be able to control things pretty well, but now...\"\nHe nods, \"What would you say is the most important thing in your life right now?\"\nI pause, and then tell him, \"My job.\"\nHe nods, \"Why did you leave your job?\"\nI pause, and then tell him, \"I didn't want to go home. I felt like I was being forced to live with my parents again. I wanted to find another place to live, one where I wouldn't have to worry about money or rent or anything else.\"\nHe nods, \"Have you considered moving somewhere else?\"\nI pause, and then tell him, \"No, I haven't really thought about it. I'll probably end up staying here until I figure out what I want to do next.\"\nHe nods, \"Do you have any friends or family that you can talk to about this?\"\nI pause, and then tell him, \"Yes, but I'm not sure if they'd understand how I feel about all of this.\"\nHe nods, \"Can I ask you to share with me some of those feelings? Tell me about them.\"\n",
