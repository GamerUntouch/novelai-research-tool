Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded.

One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

I don't know what else to say...\"\nHe nods, encouragingly, and continues, \"OK, go ahead, tell me what brought you here today?\"\nSo I begin telling him about myself: I was born and raised in San Diego, California. My mother died when I was very young, and my father remarried soon after, which caused me much pain and anger because she didn't want anything to do with me. When I was old enough to understand the situation, I ran away from home. It was a hard life living on the streets, but I managed to survive by working odd jobs. Eventually I met a guy named Frank (not his real name), and we lived together for two years before I got pregnant with our daughter, Amber. We were happy for awhile until he started cheating on me with women he worked with. He said that they wanted to 'help' me out, but I knew better. They just wanted more money than he gave them. I left him and found another job, but I lost that one too when I was caught stealing from the boss. I had nowhere to turn. Finally, I came across a website that offered help to people like me; it turned out to be a scam, but I was desperate, so I sent an email to the address listed there, hoping that I would get a reply. That's where I met Michael Szozas.\nDr. Szozas listened intently, nodding occasionally, asking questions about my history. I answered each question honestly, and he asked me to describe the dreams I've been having lately.\n\"Oh God, I can't even explain it!
