He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",

That's what I said, and I can tell by his reaction that I have done something right.   He smiles again, and leans forward to place a gentle palm on my shoulder, \"Tell me more about your problem, Tom.\"\nSo I do. I start talking, telling this story of a boy named Nicky, and then I talk about my own feelings. I describe the strange things happening to me, and I try not to laugh too hard at myself, but I find myself doing that quite often.\nDr. Szozas listens intently, nodding along, smiling occasionally. He asks questions when I pause for breath, and I answer. I think I'm making sense to him, but I don't really know. I'm pretty sure I'm getting a lot across to him, though.\nI feel better after I finish my tale, and I relax back into the cushions. I close my eyes, and rest my head against the side of the sofa. I hear the doctor's voice asking a question, and I open my eyes.\n\"Tom, I'm going to ask you a couple of questions, and I'd appreciate if you answered honestly. I'll give you a moment to consider each one, and if you aren't ready, please just say 'no'.\nDo you ever masturbate?\"\nI blink, startled. \"What? No, never. I hate touching my penis.\"\nHe nods. \"Have you ever had any sexual contact with another person other than masturbation, oral sex, or intercourse?\"\nI shake my head. \"No, I haven't touched a girl's breasts, vagina, anus, anything like that.

He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",

What do you think is happening?\"\nI shrug, \"I don't know.\"\n\"Well, let's start by getting a sense of what you've been experiencing lately.   Tell me about the last time you felt this way,\" he asks.\nSo I tell him about the day before yesterday, and I describe the feeling that came over me, and the anger I feel now. He listens intently, nodding along with my description of my feelings.\nWhen I finish, he nods, \"And when did those feelings begin? Was there a trigger event or something else that triggered them?\"\nI sigh, and I say, \"I don't know. I just started having these feelings, and they're driving me crazy. It feels like I can't stop thinking about sex, and I want to have sex all the time!\"\nDr. Szozas grins at me, \"Hmmmmm, I'd like to hear more about the thoughts that are occurring to you, and the feelings you're having. I'll ask a few questions, and I want you to answer honestly, and without judgment. I promise not to judge, and I won't push any buttons, but I need to understand.

  "prompt": "I'm seeing a counselor named Dr. Michael Szozas about an issue that I'm having. Dr. Szozas is really smart, kind, and so attractive! He has hazel eyes, glasses, wear a comfortable cardigan, slacks, and he's really tall!\nI need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\n[Period: Modern Day]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"\n",
  "result": "My name is Janae Smith.\" I pause again, \"I don't know what else to tell you. It all started yesterday... I woke up feeling really strange, and then this morning, I had this weird dream...\" I stop myself there, and just let the words hang in the air between us.\nHe looks at me expectantly, waiting for more information. I feel silly talking about dreams, but I do want to get to the point where I can explain things to him, without sounding crazy or paranoid. I continue after a short silence, \"Well, in my dream, I was walking through an old house, and I came across a room with two doors, one leading out, the other to a hallway. There were people in the hall, but they didn't seem to notice me. When I opened the door, I found a big empty space, and I thought something bad might happen if I went in there. But, when I turned back to go outside, I saw a woman standing in the doorway of the room I'd been in, and she said to me, 'You have to come with me.'\"\nDr. Szozas is listening intently now, and I am wondering if I've made a mistake. I should probably start at the beginning.\nI close my eyes and try to recall what happened the day before, \"I woke up early, and I felt really tired. I couldn't sleep. I tried to read, and I kept falling asleep. I got up, and I looked out the window, and I noticed the sun coming up. I decided to watch the sunrise on the beach, and I walked out the door and onto the deck, and the sky was purple, and the clouds were orange, and the sand was white. The water was calm, and I watched for a while, and I think I fell asleep at some point.\nWhen I awoke, I found that I wasn't on my bed anymore.",
