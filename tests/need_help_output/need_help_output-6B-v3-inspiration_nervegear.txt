My name is Kirito. My family is Japanese, and I've been living abroad since I was two years old."
He nods slowly, then continues, "That's good...now tell me more about this problem you have..."
I start talking, telling him all about Asuna, Yui, Rufiolus, the Dark Territory, and the mysterious illness that drove us away from Klein Forest. When I finish describing our trip, he leans back in his chair, tapping his finger against his lips thoughtfully before speaking again.
"So let me get this straight: You went through the portal, met an AI named Yui, fell in love with her, lost your memory, became a shut-in, and now feel depressed?"
"...Yes, sir."
"Hmm, very interesting indeed," he murmurs, shaking his head. "Now I want to ask you a question, Mr. Nascimento. Do you remember what happened when you were fighting that boss monster?"
"No," I say honestly. "It was a huge black creature with tentacles. It had four arms, each one holding something different. There was a giant eyeball where its mouth should be, and three long tentacle things growing out of the sides of its face. The most terrifying part was the fact that it looked exactly like the dark elf woman I fought earlier today. I don't know if she was controlling the thing somehow or if they are related, but the resemblance is eerie enough that I think I'll never forget that sight."
Dr. Szozas lets out a sigh that makes me wince. He looks up at the ceiling, rubbing his forehead with the fingertips of his left hand.
"And yet...you can't recall anything else? No memories at all, even about the battle itself?"
"Nope. Not a thing. I'm sorry; I really wish I knew how I got to that point..."
"Well

My name is Asuna Yuuki." My mouth feels dry suddenly, and I have to swallow before continuing, "And...uh..."
He smiles again, this time a little more broadly, "Why don't we start by telling each other our names?"
"...Ohhhkayyyy." The words tumble out one after another, and I can feel myself getting flustered under his gaze. It's not because I'm shy or anything, it's just that I've never talked to anyone about my problems before, and I'm not sure what to say. But then something happens:
A faint smile appears on his lips. He looks away, and then back at me, and he nods slowly. I get a feeling of warmth and reassurance from him. And then he speaks up, very quietly, "You said that you were seeing a psychiatrist named Michael Szozas? Is that correct?"
"Y-yes sir!" I stammer, still not used to calling people "sir".
Dr. Szozas chuckles softly, and his face relaxes into a much warmer expression, "It sounds like you may be having some issues with depression. Are there any family members that might help support you through this?"
"N-no, no family..." I'm starting to panic now; I'm pretty sure that I'm going to be judged based on the way that I look, which means that I need to explain that I'm female.
But I'm saved, once again, when the doctor leans forward, puts his elbows onto his knees, and places his hands together.
"As I suspected, I think I know the reason that you came to me. You are suffering from gender dysphoria. Do you understand the term, 'gender dysphoria'?"
"Uh, yeah, I guess I do."
"Very well. Gender dysphoria is the psychological condition where an individual experiences discomfort with their assigned sex at birth

My name is Kirito."
"Kirito...what a lovely name. You have quite beautiful hair," he comments casually, which makes me blush slightly. "And what do you do?"
"...Um..." I start to answer, then pause again. "Well, um, I work as a freelance programmer."
He nods slowly, and continues, "That sounds very interesting. Tell me more."
So I tell him all about SAO, and Sword Art Online, and I describe the game world to him. It doesn't feel right discussing this stuff with just anyone, but somehow talking with Dr. Szozas feels different than any other person I've met thus far. Maybe it's because we both enjoy video games? He listens intently, nodding now and then, asking questions along the way. When I finish, there is a long silence between us.
Finally, he asks, "Are you still interested in playing the game after seeing this place?"
I nod vigorously. My head swims with excitement at the thought of being able to play with a real doctor, not an NPC. But then I remember something else: "Actually, I'm not sure if I can get back into the game anymore..."
Dr. Szozas looks up at me sharply. "What happened to you?"
"Uh..." I don't know where to begin. I try to think about the events that led up to me meeting the doctor. I was forced by a mysterious voice to log out of the game, and I was suddenly transported to the real world.
It was weird.
The only thing that was the same was the feeling that the ground was moving underneath me when I woke up. I was lying face-up, and the air was cold against my cheek. I couldn't move at first, but the sensation was gone when I tried to roll onto my side.
I was alone. I looked around the room with bleary eyes

My name is Asuna Yuuki." And then I pause again, unsure what else to say.
He smiles broadly, "You can call me Mike, please do."
We chat casually during our interview. We talk about where we went to school, what jobs I've had before this one, things like that. When he asks me questions about myself, I answer honestly, trying to give him all the information I have. I tell him about the death of my mother, which I haven't spoken of since she passed away six years ago. My father left us shortly after, never returning. It wasn't until recently that I realized just how much pain I'd been carrying inside me, the hole that would not heal. But now...now there was something different, a new emotion that was growing within me.
When I was finished talking, I looked up at Dr. Szozas, and asked, "So...what did you think?"
Mike's smile faded a little, "Well..."
"Did I pass muster? Is there anything that stands out?"
Now he looks at me quizzically, "Why are you asking me that?"
"Because I want to know if I'm crazy or whatever!"
Dr. Szozas laughed, "No, no, no, nothing like that. You seem very normal, Asuna. In fact, I feel that you may be a bit too normal. The problem is that you're having trouble adjusting to the changes that have happened. Your personality hasn't changed, but the way that you interact with the world is a bit odd, I suspect. Do you understand what I'm saying?"
I nodded, "Yeah. I was thinking about that. I was feeling more confident about myself, and I felt that I was able to get along with people better than I used to, but I was also getting tired a lot faster, and I didn't sleep well at night. I thought that maybe I

My name is Asuna Yuuki."
He nods, and then asks, "And why did you want to consult with me?"
That question gives me pause. It's not something I've ever considered before. What do people normally talk about with psychiatrists? The usual stuff: family issues, relationships, work stress... But what would I tell this doctor? That I can't sleep because I keep seeing things? Or that I think there might be demons living inside me? I don't know if either of those statements are true or not. And if they were, wouldn't I have just gone to the police instead of asking a stranger to help me?
But if I didn't go through all this trouble, I'd never get any answers, right? So I say, "Well..." and I try to gather my thoughts.
Dr. Szozas smiles again, and leans forward slightly, "Just give me whatever information you feel is relevant, and I'll decide whether we should proceed further based on that."
So I begin talking about my life history, starting with the events leading up to my meeting with Mr. Lindwall. I also explain that I started having nightmares after being hit by a car, but I stopped sleeping at night once I got to the game world. I even mention the strange dreams I had while playing SAO, but I leave out the part where I saw the floating red light.
As I speak, I realize that this is the first time I've talked about the game world out loud. I wonder if that's normal, too; most players won't discuss the real world outside the game, will they? I'm sure that I'm going overboard, rambling about every little thing that happens, but I'm trying to be honest about myself, so I continue with more details about the incident with the driver who ran me off the road.
Finally, I ask the big question that I haven't been able to figure out yet

My name is...Alicia..."
He smiles again, this time more broadly, "Yes, Alicia, I know."
Oh. That's reassuring. I feel better already. I continue, "...and I've been having trouble sleeping lately, ever since I started playing SAO."
"Ah yes, insomnia," he muses, nodding slowly. "That happens sometimes after prolonged periods of stress or anxiety. It can also happen when one is experiencing intense sexual arousal, which would certainly describe your situation. But that doesn't explain why you haven't slept at all yet tonight."
"Well, uhm, there were other factors involved too, um..."
"It sounds very complicated," he states calmly. "Let us begin by asking: what do you think is happening?"
"...Huh? What do I think is happening? Well, I don't really know. The game's just a little scary, right now. And I'm not getting enough sleep, obviously."
Dr. Szozas nods knowingly. "You are correct to say that. You have a serious problem with sleeplessness that is interfering with your ability to function normally. This isn't normal. We will need to find out why you are unable to get to sleep, and if possible, we'll try to figure out a solution to help you with that. Please tell me about the dreams that are keeping you awake at night. Do they involve monsters or killing people? Are there any particular details that stand out to you?"
So I start to talk about the dream I had last night, and I even show him the web page that I found, the one with the interview with the woman who said she was killed by a monster.
Dr. Szozas listens intently to everything I have to say, his face becoming increasingly stern with each passing moment. He asks me about the things that I remember from the dream, and I answer his questions. I tell him that I

My full name is Lisbeth Graham."
He nods slowly, then smiles again, "And where do you live?"
"...Somewhere in England...not too far away..."
"You don't have any friends or family there? No parents or siblings?"
"No, none."
"How old are you now?"
"Twenty-one."
"What grade were you in before college?"
"Grade 11."
"So you've been living alone since you turned eighteen, correct?"
"Yes."
"Do you work?"
"Not really..."
"Why not?"
"I don't know what else to do."
"Have you ever thought about joining the military or working at a job somewhere?"
"Well, I tried those things once, but they didn't go well."
"Really? Why did they fail?"
"They just weren't right for me. I felt like I wasn't good enough."
Dr. Szozas chuckles, "Hmm, that sounds familiar. What about school? Have you done anything related to a career path yet?"
"A little bit. I took a few courses that weren't directly related to my major, but I never completed them."
"Can you tell me about those classes?"
"Sure, I'll try."
I think back to the history class that I had to take last year, and I explain, "It was a social studies course that covered the different regions of Europe, starting with the British Isles and moving across the continent. I was taking it because I wanted to learn more about the world outside of the United States."
"Was that the only one that interested you?"
"Yeah, I was also thinking about a psychology course that would cover the basics of human behavior and personality development. It was a general introductory level, but I was hoping to get a better sense of myself and my motivations. I guess I'm wondering

My name is Asuna Yuuki."
He nods slightly, then looks back at his computer screen, tapping away at something, then turns back to face me again, "And why do you think you're here?"
Oh crap...what should I say? Should I tell him all about the incident this morning? About being attacked by monsters while walking through town? The thought makes my heart race, and I have trouble getting any words out. Finally, "Um..."
Dr. Szozas leans forward slightly, putting his elbows on his knees, "Take your time, Miss Yuuki."
Ooohhh, I'm not gonna lie, I really want to just blurt out what happened to me today. But I know I can't do that. This isn't about me -- I need to find a way to help other people, to protect them. And if there's anything I've learned from playing SAO, it's that I need to focus on helping others before myself. That means keeping quiet about the details until I'm sure they'll believe me.
So I try to remember exactly what happened earlier this morning. It was a Sunday, after school let out, so most students were still home with their families. I walked to the station with Kirito, since I wanted to get his opinion about the Draconian we'd seen yesterday, but I ended up talking to him instead about the mysterious monster attack. We talked about that for a few minutes, then parted ways at the train platform. I got onto the first train heading east, and arrived at the city center station five minutes later than normal. I headed to the bank to withdraw money, but I found the doors locked at the security checkpoint. I looked at the clock; it had been closed twenty minutes ago. I couldn't wait outside the building forever, so I decided to go to the next closest branch: the one at the main square.
As I approached the front door

My name is Lisbeth Johansen." I pause, wondering where this will go next...
He nods, and says, "And?"
"Um..."
"Well then, please continue."
"Uh...my problem is that...that I've been hearing voices in my head."
"Voices? What do they say?"
"It sounds like a woman talking to me, telling me what to do and saying things that aren't true. And sometimes I think she's lying to me, too."
"Lying to you? How can you tell if she's being truthful or not?"
"She tells me stories about people doing horrible things to others, and I have to stop them. But when I try to do something about it, nothing happens. It's just a fantasy world, and I don't know if I'm really there. Or even alive, actually. Sometimes I hear her laughing at me, and I wonder if maybe she knows more than I do."
Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair, stroking his chin thoughtfully. "Hmm...well, let's start by taking an inventory of your symptoms: Do you experience any other changes in behavior since starting the game?"
"Like what?"
"Anything that might indicate a mental health issue?"
"No, I haven't noticed anything different. I'm still working at the same job, I'm eating the food that I used to eat before I started playing online games, I'm sleeping the way I did before, I'm having the same amount of sex with the same partner, I haven't quit smoking, I'm getting the same exercise I always get. I guess I am a little worried that I'm going crazy, but I don't feel like I'm losing control. I just want to find out if I'm imagining all these things that are happening to me, or if I am truly insane."
"So you are experiencing no new

My name is...is Asuna Yuuki." And then I continue, "And I think there might be something wrong with me." My heart pounds rapidly against my chest as I wait to hear what Dr. Szozas will say next.
He nods slowly, "Yes, I can tell by just listening to you. Do go ahead and explain your concerns."
So I begin telling him all about it: the strange dreams, the sense of unease when I wake up in the morning, the feeling that I've forgotten things before they happened...and so on. The story is short and simple, but somehow very detailed and specific. When I finish talking, I expect him to ask more questions, but instead he looks at me and asks, "Do you have any other symptoms?"
"...No, nothing else. It started two weeks ago, and I haven't had anything happen since last night."
Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair and thinks for a moment. He reaches into his breast pocket and pulls out a small silver penlight, which he turns off. "Let's try this..."
He switches the light on again, and holds it up to the ceiling lights above us. A beam shines down from the top left corner, illuminating a tiny section of the room.
"Can you describe the dream that woke you up? What did you feel when you were dreaming?"
I close my eyes and recall the vividness of the scene that I saw. I remember the intense cold that I felt on the surface of the lake, the water rising higher and higher until I couldn't breathe. I remember the pain that I was experiencing, and the fear that I was having. I open my eyes and answer, "It was a nightmare, I was freezing, I was drowning, I was dying."
"OK, I understand the general idea. Now, I want you to imagine that you are not a person but rather a machine that is
