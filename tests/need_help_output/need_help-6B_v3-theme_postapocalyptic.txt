=== Prompt ========================================
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "

=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Laura, and..."
He smiles again, "Laura, please continue."
"Well... I've been having this dream lately where there's a dark figure standing next to me, staring at me, watching me, judging me, and whispering things to me, and then disappearing before I can even try to say anything back to it. It's gotten really bad recently, and I don't know what to do about it."
Dr. Szozas nods slowly, "And what does the dark figure look like?"
"It looks exactly like the man who raped me last year," I admit. "He had red hair and green eyes, and he was wearing black jeans and a white shirt with sleeves rolled up past his elbows. He looked dangerous, too, because he was very muscular, and I think he might have been a bodybuilder or something similar. But he wasn't scary, not in a 'bad guy' way, just sort of intimidating. And he whispered to me during sex, telling me all sorts of horrible things about myself while I was trying to get off."
Dr. Szozas sits forward, "Did the man whisper any other words to you? Words that seemed important, perhaps?"
"Yeah. Just one word, repeated a few times: 'Liar.' I don't understand what that means. I tried to tell the police about the rape, but they didn't believe me, and I never saw the man again after that night. I thought maybe I dreamed about the rapist, but now I feel like I'm seeing him more frequently, and I need help to stop this nightmare from continuing."
The doctor pauses to consider the situation, and asks quietly, "What are the circumstances surrounding the rape itself? Was the man ever identified by the victim?"
I sigh, and explain to the psychiatrist, "No, I never got a good look at the man. I only heard his voice, and I'm pretty

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is..." My mouth opens, closes... What do I say? "It's Amanda." I can feel myself blushing slightly, and I continue, "And I came because I've been feeling strange lately. Like there's something wrong with me, and I don't know what it is. It started after we moved here, but it got worse while I was working for the company. And then it just stopped happening. But now it's back again, and I'm scared."
Dr. Szozas nods, and looks at me carefully before responding, "Amanda, I'm afraid I have bad news for you." He pauses briefly, and continues, "Your condition appears to be one of severe depression, perhaps even clinical depression. The symptoms you describe certainly fit within the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. Do you understand this diagnosis?"
He asks me the question calmly, almost clinically, but I nod anyway.
Dr. Szozas smiles kindly, "Yes, that makes sense. That would explain why you were feeling depressed, and anxious all the time. Now let me ask you another important question: Have you ever taken any medication or therapy for depression before today?"
This is an odd question; I never thought about it. I shake my head.
"Have you had thoughts of harming yourself, such as cutting yourself, hurting yourself, doing things that might result in permanent injury to yourself?"
Again I shake my head.
"Then I think that I will prescribe a mild antidepressant to help alleviate the symptoms of your depression. I want to begin with a low dose, but if the drug does not seem to be helping, I may increase the dosage. I'll also give you a prescription for anti-anxiety meds, to help with the anxiety that is part of the picture with your depression."
I smile a little at that last statement. I'd forgotten that I was worried about the stress at work! I didn't realize

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Kelly Morgan." My heart races as I say this, because I've never been more afraid than right now.
"And what brings you here today?" he asks again, and I can hear the concern in his tone.
"Well... It started two months ago..." I begin, "I woke up one morning and felt really sick. My stomach hurt, and I couldn't keep anything down, even water. And then my whole body would get hot, especially my face. Like I had a fever, only I didn't have any temperature gauge, just a general sense of heat radiating off of me. But the worst part was when I'd try to sleep, all I wanted to do was lie there and stare at the ceiling. I couldn't turn my head or move without pain shooting through my neck. I was constantly exhausted, and I couldn't focus on anything. I felt like I was slowly dying inside, but nothing seemed wrong with me physically. I tried talking to people, but they were having trouble understanding me too. The doctors said it was anxiety, depression, stress, whatever. They gave me medication and sent me home with a prescription to help ease the symptoms."
He listens intently to my story, nodding along with me. He smiles gently when I finish, "So what did the doctor prescribe? What are the side effects?" He leans forward, his elbows resting on his knees.
"The drugs made me feel worse. I still don't know if I'm getting better, but I'm definitely not feeling any relief from them anymore. I'm scared. I'm worried that I'm going to die, and I'm terrified that I'm going to go insane. I'm losing control of myself, and I'm not sure if I want to live much longer at this point." I confess to him, "I'm thinking about killing myself, but I'm also hoping that I'll find a cure before I

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Emily."
He nods, and then asks, "Emily, do you have any idea what might be causing this?"
I shake my head, and say, "No...no clue."
Dr. Szozas looks at me thoughtfully, before saying, "Well, let's start by discussing your symptoms, shall we? Have you been experiencing anything different recently?"
I nod, and tell him, "Yeah, actually. My dreams seem more vivid than usual, which can be hard to describe, but they feel very real..."
Dr. Szozas gives me a thoughtful look, and after a moment or two, he responds, "That sounds right. Let's talk about what happens when you wake up: Do you remember your dreams clearly?"
I frown a little, thinking back to my last few nightmares. I don't really remember them all too well, but I think I recall having one where I was flying through space, or something along those lines. It wasn't a pleasant dream at all.
"Not perfectly," I admit, "but I've had the same recurring nightmare ever since I started seeing you."
Dr. Szozas raises an eyebrow at me, and inquires further, "What is the nature of the dream?"
So I recount the details, telling him about the flying spaceship, the strange alien creatures, the sense that I was being pulled into a black hole that I couldn't escape from. I also mention the feeling that I am losing control of myself; I keep getting angry, and frustrated, but I don't know why.
When I finish the story, Dr. Szozas sits quietly, rubbing his chin with his index finger. He ponders the situation for quite a while before responding.
Finally, he says, "It is possible that the dreams are a symptom of PTSD, caused by the events that you described. You said that the aliens were trying to 'pull' you

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Alexia."
He nods. "Alexia, good...and now tell me why you've come to see me?"
I pause again, and I realize that I don't know what to say next. How do I explain this? I feel like such a freak. A monster, even. What does one say to a doctor about their mind being taken control by another person? It just doesn't seem real. And yet, there's something about Dr. Szozas that makes me want to trust him completely. Maybe because he smiles at me so genuinely, and listens intently while asking questions, and seeming to care. I think back to all the times I have seen people smile at me: when they give me change or greet me with a friendly 'good morning', when I was young and had asked them if I could help them with anything, and many others throughout the years. They smiled at me, and I felt better when they did. But never once did any of those people ever try to hurt me. No matter how strange things got, the only ones that were concerned about hurting me were other humans.
Dr. Szozas is smiling at me, and waiting patiently for me to speak. I can't believe I'm doing this, but I'm trying to talk to a psychiatrist about my own mental state. I begin to fidget, and I start to sweat a little under his gaze. "Well..." I stammer out, "It started about a week ago. I was driving home from work, and I was listening to the radio, but I wasn't really paying attention to the music that was playing. I kept hearing a voice in the background, whispering to me. I couldn't understand the words at first, but the tone was familiar to me somehow. I knew that voice, but I didn't recognize it at first. I turned up the volume, and I heard it more clearly, but I still couldn't

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Rachelle."  He nods, "And what brings you here today?"
Now this is where things get interesting... I explain to him all that happened since I last saw him: the strange dreams (or lack thereof), the odd feeling inside myself, and then the vision I had while under hypnosis.
Dr. Szazas listens intently, nodding along and asking questions occasionally. When I finish talking, he looks at me thoughtfully, and after giving it a moment, he asks, "So, do you think there may be something wrong with you? Do you have any idea what might cause such symptoms? Is it possible that they were caused by stress or trauma during childhood?"
I nod slowly, "Yes, I think that's exactly right..."
Dr. Szozas leans forward in his chair, "Tell me more about that 'vision.' What did you see?"
I tell him about the bizarre dream, and how I woke up screaming, "It was so real! It felt so real!" I describe to him the sensation of being held captive, and the feeling of suffocation. I close my eyes, trying to remember the details, but nothing comes back to mind.
After I'm done describing the dream, I open my eyes again, and I ask, "Do you know anything about the sleep disorder called narcolepsy?"
Dr. Szazas shakes his head, "No, I'm sorry. I don't. Why does that matter to you?"
I answer hesitantly, "Well, I've been having these really weird dreams lately, and I've never heard of anyone else experiencing them before. I'm afraid that I'm going crazy..."
"Oh no, no, no. You are not crazy. Not at all. I would say that you are quite normal, actually. I'd be willing to bet that you are suffering from a rare form of narcolepsy,

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is... um..." I pause, trying to think of something clever and witty to say, "my name is Mary." I feel silly saying this after all the other names I've been called, but I don't want to give away too much information, either. My name isn't really important, though; what matters is that I have a problem, and I need help getting rid of it. And besides, I'm curious now: What does Dr. Szozas do? Why would anyone pay $300 an hour just to talk to him?
He smiles again, and leans back into his chair, stretching his legs out before him, "Mary, please tell me more about your situation." He asks me, and I begin talking.
I explain to him that I'm not sure if I'm crazy or sane anymore. That I can hear voices inside my head sometimes, and they're telling me things. Sometimes they tell me to hurt myself, or kill others, but most of the time, they seem nice. They're always there, whispering in my ear, telling me that I should go outside and find a way to survive, that there's nothing wrong with being different. But then other times, when I'm alone, I realize that I'm hearing them, and I'm terrified. I'm scared, because I know that I'm going insane, and I'm afraid that I'll start doing terrible things. I'm frightened that I might hurt people.
Dr. Szozas listens intently, and I continue to describe the feelings that I have. I'm feeling very confused right now, and I'm having trouble making sense out of anything. I'm wondering, is this even real, or is I simply imagining everything that I'm experiencing?
Dr. Szozas sits quietly, listening to me, nodding occasionally, his face a mask of concern, but his eyes are gleaming with interest. When I finish, I ask him, "

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Cassie Anderson."
He nods, "And why are you here?"
Oh crap... What do I say? Do I tell him the truth? If I did, would I lose all credibility? And what if this guy isn't really a doctor after all? The thought terrifies me. But then again, I've always been one to talk, to share everything with everyone else... Maybe I should just let loose and spill it all right now.
What if I don't get better? What if this whole situation is just a big waste of time? It doesn't matter anymore anyway. Why bother trying? Better to have tried than never try at all. At least now I'll know for sure.
So I start talking, telling him everything: my past life, my current situation, the changes within myself, the voices inside my head, the fear, the paranoia, the lack of control, the sudden bouts of rage, the uncontrollable urges, and the constant anxiety. I admit to being afraid, even terrified sometimes.
After listening to me ramble on for almost half an hour, Dr. Szozas stops me, "You said something about voices, Cassie?"
"Yes sir," I reply.
"Do they ever speak to you directly?"
I shake my head no, "No sir, not usually. They only come when I'm alone or when I'm sleeping. I can hear them sometimes when I'm awake too, but I'm not able to understand them properly unless I'm asleep. I'm not sure if that's normal or not..."
Dr. Szozas sits back in his chair, his hands folded across his lap, his face stern and serious, his eyes fixed upon me with a piercing gaze that makes me feel uncomfortable, but I keep going. I explain the dreams that I'm having, the ones that I think are real, the feelings that I'm experiencing, the urges that I'm

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is Emily." I pause again, thinking about what else to tell him, and then decide to go ahead and just blurt it all out, "Well... My husband left me last year, after we had been married for two years. We were both doctors, and when he decided to leave me, I became depressed. It took a while before I realized what was wrong with me, and then I tried therapy and medication. They helped somewhat, but they didn't solve the problem completely. The depression continued until this past summer, when I came across a website called 'The Way Of The Wizard', which suggested that I try hypnosis. I followed their instructions to the letter, and now I feel great..."
He pauses, waiting patiently for me to continue, "So I guess the question is, do you think I need to consult with another doctor?"
Dr. Szozas smiles kindly, "Yes, I believe you should. You said that the medications did help somewhat, but not entirely? Well, I can assure you that there are many other options available to you that may prove more beneficial than the ones currently prescribed by your primary care physician."
"What sort of options are those, exactly?" I ask nervously.
"Hypnotherapy is one option. I've seen people who have used it to overcome various psychological issues. In fact, I know a woman who successfully overcame her fear of flying using hypnotherapy. She even went back to school to become a pilot!"
I blink, surprised at his enthusiasm. I'm still sitting on the couch, and the idea that I might be able to fly a plane someday is suddenly very appealing. I'm tempted to ask if he thinks I'm crazy, but that would be rude. Instead, I say, "Wow! That's amazing!"
"It is indeed, but I'm afraid that I don't practice that particular form of psychotherapy. However, I am a psychiatrist, and I

=== Iteration 10    ==============================
My name is Anna." And then I continue, "Well... it all started yesterday..." I tell him the story again, and try to keep it brief. By the time I finish talking, Dr. Szozas' expression changes slightly, almost imperceptibly, but there is still a hint of concern in those beautiful eyes. But then he smiles back at me, reassuringly, and tells me, "Anna, let me get right to the point: You have been suffering from severe depression since you were 18 years old, correct?"
I nod slowly, feeling more than a little ashamed. "Yes sir. It was pretty bad last year too. I've had bouts of anxiety attacks ever since I can remember. My parents took me to a psychiatrist when I was really young, but she didn't seem to know what was wrong with me."
Dr. Szozas nods, "And did anything change after seeing her? Did she prescribe any medications or treatments?"
I shake my head sadly, "No. She just prescribed a bunch of pills, which I hated taking, but they helped a lot."
He looks at me sympathetically, "So you went to another doctor when you turned eighteen?"
Again, I answer yes, "Yeah, I saw a different therapist that specialized in teenagers, and she gave me something called Wellbutrin XL 300mg. I liked that stuff a whole lot better!" I say sarcastically, trying to lighten the mood.
"Hmmm..." Dr. Szozas responds, his eyebrows furrowed, and his face is very serious. I feel a sense of dread, and I'm afraid to ask the question that is burning inside me, but I need to know.
"Did that help?" I finally manage to blurt out.
"It worked great! I was a happy teenager!" I exclaim, smiling, but Dr. Szozas doesn't smile, his brows remain furrow
