  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Emily Mathers.\"\nHe nods, encouragingly. \"And why did you send me this email?\"\nI tell him, \"I think I may have been abducted by aliens.\"\nThere, it just came out of my mouth. My face turns beet red. I feel embarrassed, because now everyone will know what happened to me, and they'll all probably laugh at me too. But then again, maybe not? Maybe people would understand? No one knows, except God himself. And if He doesn't want anyone else to know, than there shouldn't be any reason to talk about it.\nDr. Szozas chuckles at my comment, and responds, \"Well, I'm very sorry to hear that. We can get started with your evaluation today if you'd like.\"\nI nod, \"Yes please. I'm ready.\"\n\"OK, let's start with an examination.\" He stands up, and I follow suit, taking his place beside the chair. \"Can we turn off the overhead light?\"\nI flick the switch, and darkness envelopes us. I reach out with my right hand, finding the back of his head, and I pull him close to me, pressing our foreheads together. His lips brush against mine, and I am surprised at their warmth and wetness. I breathe deeply into his neck, inhaling his scent. It smells sweet and masculine. I don't realize that I'm holding onto his shoulders until I feel his arms wrap around me.\nWe kiss slowly at first, and I find myself enjoying the sensations. His hands slide into my hair, massaging the nape of my neck. I move my left hand to his chest, feeling his heart beating rapidly beneath his t-shirt. His shirt is unbuttoned, and I caress his bare skin with the tips of my fingers. His body is warm, solid; I am amazed at how much I enjoy his touch.\nI",

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Tariq.\"\nHe nods, \"And why did you seek counseling?\"\n\"Because... because...\" I can't put it all together. It's too much, this whole day, I've been through so many emotions, and now I feel lost. Why would anyone want to go through life without knowing their own mind? What does one even know about themselves? I ask myself, \"Why do we have to be conscious of ourselves? And what happens when our minds aren't functioning properly?\"\n\"Ahh, yes, good questions. Let's start there,\" he smiles, \"Have you ever had any problems with your memory before today?\"\n\"No, not really,\" I reply, and then I think back to the time when I was fourteen years old, when I went into the woods with friends, and they didn't return home. We were just kids, I thought nothing bad would happen, but a car came by, and it was an accident, and I remember seeing blood everywhere, and screaming at the top of my lungs. The police showed up soon after, and took us to the hospital. I woke up in a coma, and I couldn't recall anything about that night until later.\nDr. Szozas looks at me curiously, \"Do you remember what happened that night?\"\n\"Not exactly, but I have nightmares sometimes, where I hear voices calling to me. I wake up, confused, unable to tell if I'm awake or asleep, but I always wonder if I'll get another chance to live a normal life. I guess that's the best way I can describe the feeling,\" I say, trying to be honest with the man I've never met before.\nDr. Szozas responds, \"Well, that certainly sounds like a traumatic event. I'm sorry to hear that you suffered such a loss at the hands of others. I assume that the trauma caused you to lose some memories about that incident,",

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock.

His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

Something is causing this change in behavior, and I don't know what it is. I've never felt like this before. And I'm worried that I'm losing touch with reality.\"\nHe nods slowly, listening intently, and then he responds, \"OK, let's get started, shall we?\" He smiles again, showing those perfect teeth, and asks me questions: What day is today? Where do you live? Do you have any pets? How old are you? Have you ever had problems sleeping or difficulty concentrating? Do you suffer from depression? Anxiety? Are you having thoughts of harming yourself?\nIt goes on like that for quite a while, and I answer each question honestly, although not completely truthfully. When asked if I drink alcohol, I admit that yes, I enjoy a glass of wine now and then, but that I don't usually consume more than one glass per week. I also tell him that I smoke marijuana occasionally, but that I rarely partake of harder drugs.\nWhen I mention that I'm gay, he looks at me curiously, \"How did you come to that conclusion?\"\nI shrug, \"I just am. I'm attracted to men. I'm attracted to women too, but I'm mostly interested in guys. I'm bisexual, I suppose.\"\nDr. Szozas sits quietly, nodding to himself, \"So you are bi-sexual. That explains a lot about your behaviors. You are aware that others find you attractive, correct?\"\n\"Yes, I'm pretty sure they would. I've always thought that I was handsome, but I wasn't",
