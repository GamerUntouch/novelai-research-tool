  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Alex.\" I pause again, then continue, \"Alexandra.\" My heart races a little faster now. The doctor nods, waiting patiently for more details. I swallow hard, then continue, \"I'm here because...well...\" I trail off, searching for words. What can I tell this guy? How do I describe what I've been experiencing since last week? It feels like there's something wrong with me. Something very bad. And yet, I don't know if I want anyone else to help me figure out what it is.\nDr. Szozas continues to wait, and I feel trapped by his stare. Finally I decide to just blurt it all out, \"Well, I've felt different ever since I started using the internet.\"\nHe looks at me with an odd expression. A mixture of confusion, curiosity, and amusement. \"What did you use?\" He asks cautiously.\nOh god, I shouldn't have said anything. But maybe I should trust him. Maybe he'll understand. \"The web. The Internet. I spend a lot of time online.\" I say quietly, trying to keep myself calm.\n\"Have you had any unusual thoughts or feelings while accessing the net?\"\nNow I really don't know where to begin. I shrug, not sure how to answer his question. \"Sometimes I think things that seem pretty strange. Like I'd never heard them before. Or they sound funny when I hear them out loud. Sometimes I get a sense that I'm not supposed to be doing certain things that I find out about from the internet. I haven't done much to investigate that feeling, though.\" I explain.\nThe doctor frowns, purses his lips, thinking about what I've told him. Then he replies, \"Do you remember the first thing that happened to you after you used the net?\"\nI shake my head no, not sure if I should be telling the truth.\nThe psychiatrist sigh",

I was able to stop the bleeding eventually, but I'm still weak, I can't even stand up straight without being shaky. I'm scared that I'm going to pass out at any moment. I'm tired, I feel exhausted, I'm having trouble concentrating. I'm worried about passing out because I'm afraid that I'll die. I'm terrified that I'm dying, and I'm also very confused about what's happening to me. I'm hoping that I might be able to figure out what is wrong with me,",

One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

What do I tell this doctor? Why did I decide to contact him? How does one describe their own problems to another person without sounding completely crazy? What if he thinks I'm nuts? Should I mention my dreams? Or what about my waking life? Is there something wrong with me? Do I have any sort of mental illness? Am I just depressed? If I were diagnosed with depression would it go away if I had a baby? But if I had a baby wouldn't I still feel bad? Maybe I should start at the beginning...\nDr. Szozas watches me closely, waiting patiently, I suppose I can do this. \"Susan, I think we need to talk about your problem, what brought you to my office today?\"\nHe leans forward, and rests his elbows on his knees, his hands clasped together between his legs. \"Susan, I'm listening to you, please continue.\"\nSo I try to explain myself. I try to put into words the feelings that are driving me insane. The emotions, sensations, memories, and thoughts that I've been experiencing since I came home from work yesterday afternoon. I speak slowly, carefully, trying not to rush through things, not wanting to say anything that will sound silly or weird.\nAs I speak I become more aware that I am being observed, studied. His gaze never leaves me, but his face shows a range of expressions: interest, curiosity, concern, empathy, and finally a smile.\nWhen I finish speaking, he asks me to repeat the story back to him, to verify that I understand the details correctly. I am happy to comply; I want to be sure that I am not misunderstanding or misinterpreting the situation.\nAfter I am finished telling the tale, he responds with a question, \"",
