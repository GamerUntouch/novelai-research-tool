  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Taryn Lintz.\"\nHe nods, and then asks, \"What do you know about dragons?\"\nOh shit, did I say something wrong? But this guy doesn't seem mad or anything, just curious. And I don't want to offend him either, because I really need help. \"Well... um...\"\n\"Why don't we start with what you've learned about them through the web,\" he responds, his smile broadening again.\nSo I tell him all about my research, and how much I have discovered about their culture, history, language, etc., and I even describe the dragon eggs. He listens intently, nodding along as I talk, occasionally asking questions or making comments. When I finish talking, he sits quietly for a few moments, taking notes on a legal pad.\nThen he looks up at me, \"You mentioned that you were interested in becoming a dragon rider, is that correct?\"\n\"Yes sir,\" I answer, \"but I'm not sure if I can do it.\"\n\"Taryn, please call me Michael. You said that you wanted to become a dragon rider, but I assume there are other reasons for wanting to join the Dragon Riders Guild besides simply being able to fly. What are those reasons?\"\n\"Um, well, I think I'd be good at helping people, I think I would enjoy working with children, I think I might be good at diplomacy, I feel that I could be a leader, I think I could be a great warrior, I think I could be a healer...\"\nDr. Szozas smiles at me, \"That's a lot to digest. I'll be honest with you; I find the idea that you are a possible candidate fascinating. I'm intrigued by the fact that you are a human that is capable of having a conversation with a drake, and that you are also a female that is interested in the role of a dragon rider. I",

I have to get this out somehow. \"There are rumors that the humans are experimenting with our DNA, creating new breeds, hybrids between human and dragon bloodlines. They are trying to create something that is stronger than a normal human, but still obeys their commands. Something that is a little smarter, too, I suppose. I believe that is what the humans call a super-dragon. The dragons are against these experiments because it would be impossible to control the power that the super-dragons possess, and the humans might use them to harm the rest of us.\" I swallow hard, but I continue to speak",

    " haven't really explained myself yet, \"Well, I've been trying to find out more about dragons, and I know that they used to be able to fly freely through the skies, but now all",
    " the flying is restricted, and we can only go where humans tell us to go, or else there will be consequences.\"\n\"Consequences?\" he repeats, raising an eyebrow, \"Like being",
    " burned alive, perhaps?\"\nOh dear, I hadn't thought about that possibility, but I'm not sure if I should admit to such a terrible crime, \"Yes, that's one way they",
    " punish us. But I also hear stories about other ways.\" I pause a moment, hoping that I won't regret revealing anything to him, but I feel compelled to continue anyway. I have to get",
    " this out somehow. \"There are rumors that the humans are experimenting with our DNA, creating new breeds, hybrids between human and dragon bloodlines. They are trying to create something that is stronger than a",
    " normal human, but still obeys their commands. Something that is a little smarter, too, I suppose. I believe that is what the humans call a super-dragon. The dragons are against these",
    " experiments because it would be impossible to control the power that the super-dragons possess, and the humans might use them to harm the rest of us.\" I swallow hard, but I continue to speak"

Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

All I can tell you is this: I feel different. Different than any dragon I've ever met before, or even heard of. And I have been having dreams since I turned fifteen years old, which started after the Battle of Tarsus. The dream always starts the same way. It begins with a small child waking up in bed. In my case, it's usually a little girl, maybe five or six years old. She wakes up crying, and her mother comes into the room to comfort her. The woman holds the sleeping child close to her chest, rocking gently back and forth until she falls asleep again. But then, the scene changes to an older boy, perhaps twelve years old. This time the boy awakes in his own bedroom, where he finds himself alone. He hears voices outside his window, whispering to each other. They are speaking a foreign language, but he understands them well enough to figure out they are saying, \"Don't worry about it. You'll get used to it soon enough. Just try to ignore the nightmares. If you keep thinking about them, that will only make things worse.\"\nAnd now I am awake, sitting in the doctor's office, telling him all about the strange dreams that I had last night. I described the scene to him exactly as I saw it in the dream.\nDr. Szozas listens intently, and asks, \"What does that mean to you?\"\n\"Well, I'm not sure. I just woke up one morning and I felt something was wrong. I couldn't explain what was bothering me, and I didn't want to go to school, because I knew that I would be teased about the way I was acting. So I went to the library to look through",

  "prompt": "I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",
  "result": "My name is Ddraig Astaroth.\" The room goes silent. And then he asks, very slowly, \"And...why are you here?\"\nSo I tell him, starting with the first day I met Talon, and how I felt this strange connection between us, and how I just knew there was something more than friendship between us. How I had always been drawn to him, even before we became dragonets. I describe our training sessions together, and how I felt such excitement and joy during those times, and how I never wanted them to end.\nHe listens intently, asking questions only when necessary to clarify a point. When I finish describing the entire experience, including the events leading up to the first time I realized what was happening between us, he sits back in his chair and looks at me thoughtfully.\nFinally, he responds, \"Ddraig Astaroth, let me ask you a question: do you believe that dragons can change their sexual orientation? Or are they born gay?\"\nI stare at him, not knowing where to begin responding, \"Well...\" I pause, thinking carefully about his question. If I were asked this same question today, I would have a hard time answering; I don't know if I believe that a person is 'born' homosexual or bisexual, but I also realize that I've seen enough evidence that it is possible. But I still feel like I should answer the question honestly.\n\"Yes,\" I say at last.\n\"You understand that homosexuality is considered a perversion by most people, right?\" he probes further.\n\"Yeah,\" I reply, feeling somewhat uncomfortable with the topic.\n\"Do you think that the practice of homosexuality is wrong?\"\n\"No, I suppose not,\" I admit.\n\"But if a person is born a homosexual, does that make it any less wrong to commit the act of sodomy with another male or female?\"\n\"That doesn't seem fair",

He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"",

I think there may have been a spell cast on me recently, by a dragon.\"\nDr. Szozas looks up at me sharply, then returns to staring intently at me. \"What do you mean?\"\n\"A few days ago I was flying along, minding my own business, and suddenly I felt this sensation, like something had taken hold of my head. It was extremely uncomfortable, almost painful, and I tried to shake it off, but nothing seemed to work. The more I fought against it, the stronger it got until finally I couldn't fight any longer and I just let go. And when I did, I fell unconscious, or maybe passed out? When I woke up, it was night time, and I realized that my wings were gone, and I didn't know where I was. All I knew was that I'd lost control of myself somehow, and now I'm here.\"\nDr. Szozas sits forward in his chair, \"Do you feel anything else missing from you, perhaps a part of your body that isn't attached anymore?\"\n\"No, I don't remember feeling anything like that happen to me before, but I can't say that I haven't experienced anything unusual since then. I've also noticed that I seem to be having trouble with my memory, which is frustrating because I thought I used to be a pretty good student. I usually retain information quite well, but lately I find that I forget things that I should easily recall.
